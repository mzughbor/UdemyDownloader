1
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:13,590
What is niche marketing and why should you get involved.

2
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:16,770
Niche marketing is all about targeting a specific part of a market.

3
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:23,850
To succeed with niche marketing you need to one identify the best niche to understand what the customers

4
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:25,620
in the niche want and need.

5
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:29,070
3 provide the customers with what they want and need.

6
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:32,820
It is all about narrowly defining a potential customer base.

7
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:35,530
These are often a subset of a larger sector.

8
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:36,760
Think about this.

9
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:42,000
Weight loss is a huge market that is always in demand but trying to tackle this niche would be really

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:42,930
tough.

11
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:46,130
There are several sub niches available in this niche.

12
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:47,680
Here are some examples.

13
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:50,640
Weight loss for men weight loss for women.

14
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:56,880
The paleo diet the Kito diet getting rid of belly fat weight loss for seniors.

15
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:59,730
Each of these subspecies is very large.

16
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:03,900
One of the mistakes that newbie niche marketers make is to try and go after massive markets such as

17
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:06,260
weight loss because of the demand.

18
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:10,560
The trouble is with a strategy like this is that a lot of people searching for this term are looking

19
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:15,300
for free information and have no intention whatsoever of making a purchase.

20
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:20,670
On the other hand if you were to target the paleo diet then there will be a number of commercial intent

21
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:24,650
keywords that you can go after here in the section and keyword research.

22
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:29,720
We will explain this in more detail for now just accept that there is more chance of making a sale and

23
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:31,320
a suddenness like this.

24
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:34,030
Why should you get involved with niche marketing.

25
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:37,920
If you are not totally sure whether you should get involved with niche marketing then take a look at

26
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,140
these benefits.

27
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:44,940
Competition is less intense if you select the right subnet than the market will not be as crowded as

28
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:46,210
a major niche.

29
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:50,640
A lot of people will not bother with your chosen niche as they won't think that is large enough.

30
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:55,170
Some companies have a lot of money to throw at the larger niches so just let them do that.

31
00:01:55,230 --> 00:02:00,660
You can really understand your target market really understanding your customer is essential to niche

32
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:02,220
marketing success.

33
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:06,570
When you focus on a specific niche you can really drill down to find out what the demographics of your

34
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:09,120
market are and what they are looking for.

35
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:11,360
You will only make money from your niche marketing efforts.

36
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:14,330
If you provide your customers with what they're looking for.

37
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:18,750
Fortunately there are several ways to do this and we will take a look at what kind of products and services

38
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:22,020
you should offer in your niche market in a later video.

39
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:27,060
You can become an expert increasing your expert status in your chosen niche will help you to attract

40
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:30,660
more potential customers to your website and other marketing channels.

41
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:35,370
There are all kinds of benefits from becoming an expert in your niche such as getting referrals other

42
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:40,080
people that like your content will be more likely to share with their friends and you will be seen as

43
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,350
an authority.

44
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:46,500
People will naturally gravitate towards authority figures in each there are going to be a few experts

45
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:52,110
at a niece like paleo diet as opposed to many in the much more general weight loss niche.

46
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:57,320
So by choosing a targeted niche you increase your chances of becoming a dominant power within it.

47
00:02:57,390 --> 00:03:03,300
It's easier to market in a targeted niche if you go after a huge niche like weight loss then you will

48
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:07,430
have to spend a lot more money effort and time reaching their audience.

49
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:13,470
This is not a practical proposition for most online marketers who have limited finances time and resources.

50
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:15,510
There are no new niche markets.

51
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:20,160
A lot of online marketers make the mistake of trying to find a totally unique niche market.

52
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:22,350
This is just a waste of time.

53
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:25,800
You need to accept the fact that there are no new niche markets.

54
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:30,180
If you discover a niche where there is little or no digital marketing going on then there is likely

55
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:32,370
to be a very good reason for this.

56
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,210
There is no money in the niche.

57
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:39,120
There is just no point spending time effort and money becoming an expert in a niche where nobody buys

58
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,180
anything.

59
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,740
This is a hobby and a pretty pointless one at that.

60
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:45,740
If this sounds brutal then it is meant to be.

61
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:49,890
We want you to succeed in niche marketing which means making money.

62
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:54,030
You will have to spend a bit of money and certainly some time and effort establishing yourself as a

63
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:55,740
leader in your niche.

64
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:57,630
Why would you do this for nothing.

65
00:03:57,670 --> 00:04:02,130
OK you might be totally passionate about a Isa you just want to get back to the community.

66
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:03,200
That's fine.

67
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:06,620
And if it is the case then this training is not for you.

68
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:11,520
At the end of the day competition in your chosen niche is a good thing because it tells you that people

69
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:17,010
are spending money online marketers were not continually spend on Google ads for example if this wasn't

70
00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:18,060
the case.

71
00:04:18,209 --> 00:04:23,850
Evergreen niches we want to end this video with an explanation of Evergreen niches.

72
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:29,190
This is a term that you may well have heard of but might not fully understand and Evergreen niche is

73
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:31,980
one where you can make sales all year round.

74
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:37,460
For several years a good example of an evergreen niche is self-help or personal development.

75
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:38,390
Why.

76
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:43,950
Because there will always be a lot of people experiencing the same problems year after year.

77
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:47,050
They want to be more confident or improve their self-esteem.

78
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:52,230
They want to know how to set goals properly and achieve them and Evergreen niche has not affected much

79
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:54,510
by time or periods of the year.

80
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:57,580
Contrast this with the Halloween niche for example.

81
00:04:57,660 --> 00:04:59,780
This is a once a year opportunity to make money.

82
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:00,890
OK.

83
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:05,640
You may make a little bit of money from people that like the plan for Halloween really early but most

84
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:10,640
of the activity is going to be happening in the month of Tobar only here are other examples of evergreen

85
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:14,090
issues weight loss health and fitness.

86
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:16,000
Making Money Online.

87
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,220
Things change rapidly in this niche but the demand is always there.

88
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:24,940
Relationships cooking and recipes in the next video we will look at the best ways to come up with a

89
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:28,860
list of niche market ideas that you can test before making your final decision.
