00:10.020 --> 00:13.590
What is niche marketing and why should you get involved.

00:13.740 --> 00:16.770
Niche marketing is all about targeting a specific part of a market.

00:16.950 --> 00:23.850
To succeed with niche marketing you need to one identify the best niche to understand what the customers

00:23.850 --> 00:25.620
in the niche want and need.

00:25.660 --> 00:29.070
3 provide the customers with what they want and need.

00:29.280 --> 00:32.820
It is all about narrowly defining a potential customer base.

00:32.820 --> 00:35.530
These are often a subset of a larger sector.

00:35.550 --> 00:36.760
Think about this.

00:36.810 --> 00:42.000
Weight loss is a huge market that is always in demand but trying to tackle this niche would be really

00:42.000 --> 00:42.930
tough.

00:42.930 --> 00:46.130
There are several sub niches available in this niche.

00:46.140 --> 00:47.680
Here are some examples.

00:47.700 --> 00:50.640
Weight loss for men weight loss for women.

00:50.640 --> 00:56.880
The paleo diet the Kito diet getting rid of belly fat weight loss for seniors.

00:56.940 --> 00:59.730
Each of these subspecies is very large.

00:59.730 --> 01:03.900
One of the mistakes that newbie niche marketers make is to try and go after massive markets such as

01:03.900 --> 01:06.260
weight loss because of the demand.

01:06.270 --> 01:10.560
The trouble is with a strategy like this is that a lot of people searching for this term are looking

01:10.560 --> 01:15.300
for free information and have no intention whatsoever of making a purchase.

01:15.300 --> 01:20.670
On the other hand if you were to target the paleo diet then there will be a number of commercial intent

01:20.700 --> 01:24.650
keywords that you can go after here in the section and keyword research.

01:24.650 --> 01:29.720
We will explain this in more detail for now just accept that there is more chance of making a sale and

01:29.730 --> 01:31.320
a suddenness like this.

01:31.560 --> 01:34.030
Why should you get involved with niche marketing.

01:34.290 --> 01:37.920
If you are not totally sure whether you should get involved with niche marketing then take a look at

01:37.920 --> 01:39.140
these benefits.

01:39.150 --> 01:44.940
Competition is less intense if you select the right subnet than the market will not be as crowded as

01:44.940 --> 01:46.210
a major niche.

01:46.260 --> 01:50.640
A lot of people will not bother with your chosen niche as they won't think that is large enough.

01:50.640 --> 01:55.170
Some companies have a lot of money to throw at the larger niches so just let them do that.

01:55.230 --> 02:00.660
You can really understand your target market really understanding your customer is essential to niche

02:00.660 --> 02:02.220
marketing success.

02:02.220 --> 02:06.570
When you focus on a specific niche you can really drill down to find out what the demographics of your

02:06.570 --> 02:09.120
market are and what they are looking for.

02:09.120 --> 02:11.360
You will only make money from your niche marketing efforts.

02:11.370 --> 02:14.330
If you provide your customers with what they're looking for.

02:14.340 --> 02:18.750
Fortunately there are several ways to do this and we will take a look at what kind of products and services

02:18.750 --> 02:22.020
you should offer in your niche market in a later video.

02:22.020 --> 02:27.060
You can become an expert increasing your expert status in your chosen niche will help you to attract

02:27.060 --> 02:30.660
more potential customers to your website and other marketing channels.

02:30.690 --> 02:35.370
There are all kinds of benefits from becoming an expert in your niche such as getting referrals other

02:35.370 --> 02:40.080
people that like your content will be more likely to share with their friends and you will be seen as

02:40.080 --> 02:41.350
an authority.

02:41.370 --> 02:46.500
People will naturally gravitate towards authority figures in each there are going to be a few experts

02:46.500 --> 02:52.110
at a niece like paleo diet as opposed to many in the much more general weight loss niche.

02:52.110 --> 02:57.320
So by choosing a targeted niche you increase your chances of becoming a dominant power within it.

02:57.390 --> 03:03.300
It's easier to market in a targeted niche if you go after a huge niche like weight loss then you will

03:03.300 --> 03:07.430
have to spend a lot more money effort and time reaching their audience.

03:07.440 --> 03:13.470
This is not a practical proposition for most online marketers who have limited finances time and resources.

03:13.470 --> 03:15.510
There are no new niche markets.

03:15.510 --> 03:20.160
A lot of online marketers make the mistake of trying to find a totally unique niche market.

03:20.160 --> 03:22.350
This is just a waste of time.

03:22.440 --> 03:25.800
You need to accept the fact that there are no new niche markets.

03:25.860 --> 03:30.180
If you discover a niche where there is little or no digital marketing going on then there is likely

03:30.180 --> 03:32.370
to be a very good reason for this.

03:32.400 --> 03:34.210
There is no money in the niche.

03:34.410 --> 03:39.120
There is just no point spending time effort and money becoming an expert in a niche where nobody buys

03:39.120 --> 03:40.180
anything.

03:40.200 --> 03:42.740
This is a hobby and a pretty pointless one at that.

03:42.750 --> 03:45.740
If this sounds brutal then it is meant to be.

03:45.870 --> 03:49.890
We want you to succeed in niche marketing which means making money.

03:49.890 --> 03:54.030
You will have to spend a bit of money and certainly some time and effort establishing yourself as a

03:54.030 --> 03:55.740
leader in your niche.

03:55.740 --> 03:57.630
Why would you do this for nothing.

03:57.670 --> 04:02.130
OK you might be totally passionate about a Isa you just want to get back to the community.

04:02.130 --> 04:03.200
That's fine.

04:03.450 --> 04:06.620
And if it is the case then this training is not for you.

04:06.780 --> 04:11.520
At the end of the day competition in your chosen niche is a good thing because it tells you that people

04:11.520 --> 04:17.010
are spending money online marketers were not continually spend on Google ads for example if this wasn't

04:17.010 --> 04:18.060
the case.

04:18.210 --> 04:23.850
Evergreen niches we want to end this video with an explanation of Evergreen niches.

04:23.910 --> 04:29.190
This is a term that you may well have heard of but might not fully understand and Evergreen niche is

04:29.190 --> 04:31.980
one where you can make sales all year round.

04:31.980 --> 04:37.460
For several years a good example of an evergreen niche is self-help or personal development.

04:37.470 --> 04:38.390
Why.

04:38.490 --> 04:43.950
Because there will always be a lot of people experiencing the same problems year after year.

04:43.950 --> 04:47.050
They want to be more confident or improve their self-esteem.

04:47.100 --> 04:52.230
They want to know how to set goals properly and achieve them and Evergreen niche has not affected much

04:52.230 --> 04:54.510
by time or periods of the year.

04:54.510 --> 04:57.580
Contrast this with the Halloween niche for example.

04:57.660 --> 04:59.780
This is a once a year opportunity to make money.

05:00.440 --> 05:00.890
OK.

05:00.900 --> 05:05.640
You may make a little bit of money from people that like the plan for Halloween really early but most

05:05.640 --> 05:10.640
of the activity is going to be happening in the month of Tobar only here are other examples of evergreen

05:10.640 --> 05:14.090
issues weight loss health and fitness.

05:14.230 --> 05:16.000
Making Money Online.

05:16.000 --> 05:19.220
