Introduction online niche marketing is not new.

00:13.250 --> 00:17.420
It has been going on for several years but only a small percentage of online marketers that try it are

00:17.420 --> 00:18.680
successful.

00:18.680 --> 00:23.660
While we cannot be specific about exactly why people fail it is safe to say that mistakes are being

00:23.660 --> 00:26.870
made which are leading to niche Web site owners to give up.

00:26.920 --> 00:31.190
Is very likely that choosing the wrong niche is a contributing factor to the high levels of failure

00:31.760 --> 00:35.640

00:35.660 --> 00:40.580

00:40.580 --> 00:45.110
viability and how to drive targeted traffic to your niche Web site.

00:45.110 --> 00:49.670
You may see people in the Internet marketing space claim that this is no longer possible to make a good

00:49.670 --> 00:51.470
profit from niche marketing.

00:51.470 --> 00:52.950
This is not true.

00:52.970 --> 00:54.950
Not all niches are saturated.

00:54.950 --> 00:58.880
In fact this is really an impossible thing to happen.

00:58.880 --> 01:03.870

01:03.950 --> 01:09.410
If you follow the advice in this guide then you will provide yourself with the maximum chance of success.

01:09.410 --> 01:10.860
Don't Believe the Hype.

01:10.910 --> 01:12.310
Niche marketing does work.

01:12.320 --> 01:18.030
If you do it correctly there are niche websites being sold every day for large amounts of money.

01:18.050 --> 01:21.480
These websites are generating regular income and have a good following.

01:21.620 --> 01:25.810
If niche marketing didn't work then this situation wouldn't exist.

01:25.970 --> 01:31.580

01:31.580 --> 01:36.190

There are no shortcuts.

01:37.910 --> 01:42.530
You need to be prepared to roll up your sleeves and do the necessary research to dramatically improve

01:42.530 --> 01:44.350
your chances of success.

01:44.390 --> 01:48.600
Once you've created one profitable niche marketing site you can create more.
