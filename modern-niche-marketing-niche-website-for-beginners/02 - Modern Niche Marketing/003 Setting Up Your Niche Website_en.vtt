00:10.070 --> 00:14.670
Setting up your niche Web site before you start getting excited about setting up your new niche Web

00:14.670 --> 00:15.040
site.

00:15.050 --> 00:19.970
You need to think about how you're going to get targeted visitor traffic to it in a later video we will

00:19.970 --> 00:21.880
discuss a number of ways that you can do this.

00:22.340 --> 00:26.880
But we want to start this video off by discussing SEO Search Engine Optimization.

00:27.020 --> 00:32.060
A lot of online marketers think that SEO is really too difficult these days with all of the changes

00:32.060 --> 00:35.190
that Google has made to its search engine algorithm.

00:35.190 --> 00:41.150
But this is a big mistake because it's actually easier to rank web pages now if they are optimized correctly.

00:41.150 --> 00:44.810
So the first thing you need to do is keyword research.

00:44.840 --> 00:48.530
The best niche websites start with comprehensive keyword research.

00:48.550 --> 00:53.000
We have already mentioned the google keyword planner and how you can use this to identify search volumes

00:53.000 --> 00:55.340
and related keywords for your niche.

00:55.340 --> 00:57.540
You need to take this a step further now.

00:57.730 --> 01:02.210
Unique Web site needs to be organized around the different types of keywords that you uncover.

01:02.210 --> 01:07.430
We recommend that you use the WordPress blogging platform for your niche Web site and it is very easy

01:07.430 --> 01:09.770
to set up different categories with this.

01:09.800 --> 01:13.120
This is what Google and the other search engines want you to do.

01:13.310 --> 01:17.380
So you want to generate a list of as many keywords for your list as you can.

01:17.390 --> 01:22.220
You're not going to rank your individual web pages for all these keywords but you certainly will for

01:22.220 --> 01:27.140
some of them as your Web site grows and becomes more of an authority then you will start to rank for

01:27.140 --> 01:29.510
some of more competitive terms.

01:29.540 --> 01:34.640
Think about the future now SEO is not a fast traffic solution but a long term one.

01:34.880 --> 01:39.740
You can get traffic to your niche Web site using other methods as your site develops but you always

01:39.740 --> 01:43.340
need to have SEO as the foundation of your niche Web site.

01:43.340 --> 01:47.630
Go to the google keyword planner and start by entering in your seed keyword.

01:47.630 --> 01:51.530
As we said before the planner will make suggestions for related keywords.

01:51.530 --> 01:55.930
You can then use these related keywords to find other related keywords.

01:56.000 --> 01:59.330
Set aside a few hours to create your initial list of keywords.

01:59.450 --> 02:03.350
It is not difficult to come up with hundreds of different keywords for your niche Web site.

02:03.380 --> 02:09.110
You can export the keywords that you find from the google keyword planner in CSP format and create Microsoft

02:09.110 --> 02:12.310
Excel or other format spreadsheets from this.

02:12.380 --> 02:15.260
These spreadsheets will be your mastered keyword lists.

02:15.350 --> 02:20.510
You will have a few to work keywords such as paleo diet some three word keywords such as paleo weight

02:20.510 --> 02:26.900
loss and quite a number of four and more keywords which will be your long tail keywords the long tail

02:26.900 --> 02:31.820
keywords will not have massive search volume but they will be a lot easier to rank for without too much

02:31.820 --> 02:32.770
effort.

02:32.780 --> 02:35.680
These will be the start of your free traffic from the search engines.

02:35.930 --> 02:40.130
Search engine traffic is the very best because it is really targeted.

02:40.130 --> 02:44.720
If someone is searching for paleo diet weight loss then this is very specific.

02:44.720 --> 02:48.170
They are truly interested in using the paleo diet to lose weight.

02:48.170 --> 02:52.220
Your web pages need to be in the search results for these kinds of terms so that you can provide the

02:52.220 --> 02:57.410
answers that people are looking for and either generate a new lead for your email list or make a sale

02:57.410 --> 02:58.800
or a commission.

02:58.850 --> 03:03.890
You need to understand that every keyword that you find will have a level of search engine competitiveness.

03:03.890 --> 03:08.030
Usually the higher the search volume the more competitive the keyword term will be.

03:08.030 --> 03:10.070
There are exceptions of course.

03:10.400 --> 03:14.910
If a keyword is very competitive it will take a very long time for you to rank high in Google and the

03:14.920 --> 03:16.480
other search engines for it.

03:16.610 --> 03:21.170
Personal terms such as paleo it will probably be impossible for you to rank on the first page for this

03:21.170 --> 03:22.720
no matter what you do.

03:22.880 --> 03:27.980
So you need to know how competitive the keywords in your list are and then determine how competitive

03:27.980 --> 03:29.090
they are.

03:29.090 --> 03:33.890
Please note that this is not the same as the competition column in the google keyword planner.

03:33.890 --> 03:37.780
This is the ads competition and will not be of any use to you.

03:37.820 --> 03:42.650
It is possible to make an assessment of keyword competition manually but this requires a lot of skill

03:42.650 --> 03:43.760
and time.

03:43.760 --> 03:46.240
Fortunately there are the ways you can do this.

03:46.250 --> 03:48.820
Here are the two methods that we recommend.

03:48.860 --> 03:55.520
Traffic Travis this is a really great SEO tool used by the professionals but very few niche marketers.

03:55.520 --> 03:58.650
You can download a free version at traffic Travis dot com.

03:58.670 --> 04:02.930
The software does a lot of great things for SEO but one of the most valuable is that it will tell you

04:02.930 --> 04:05.010
the competitiveness of keywords.

04:05.240 --> 04:08.580
We recommend that you download the free version and give it a try first.

04:08.690 --> 04:13.250
You can only look at a few keywords a day with the free version but you can see if you like the software

04:13.340 --> 04:18.100
and then decide on whether or not to purchase the professional version at around ninety seven dollars.

04:18.350 --> 04:23.450
When you use traffic Travis to estimate the FCO competition of a keyword it will tell you what it believes

04:23.450 --> 04:25.180
to be the level of difficulty.

04:25.190 --> 04:34.040
This is the range easy relatively easy medium difficult very difficult extremely difficult.

04:34.040 --> 04:38.540
Anything that is easy relatively easy or medium is fair game.

04:38.600 --> 04:40.380
The others will take a lot more work.

04:40.610 --> 04:44.150
Traffic Travis queries Google several times to estimate keyword difficulty.

04:44.210 --> 04:46.630
And lately Google has placed restrictions on this.

04:46.640 --> 04:50.330
So analyzing hundreds of terms at once isn't possible anymore.

04:50.450 --> 04:51.870
A ref scam.

04:51.980 --> 04:53.920
This is a paid subscription service.

04:53.990 --> 04:59.450
They do have an offer for seven dollars for seven days at the time of writing at a ref dot com a refs

04:59.480 --> 05:04.700
is the king of the FCO analysis programs that will provide more accurate and up to date information

05:04.730 --> 05:07.100
than any of the other programs out there.

05:07.190 --> 05:11.810
It also has feature to measure keyword difficulty in a similar way to traffic Travis.

05:11.810 --> 05:16.550
The difference is that a refs has all of this information already stored so there is no waiting for

05:16.550 --> 05:17.680
the results.

05:17.780 --> 05:23.350
If you are serious about SEO then the monthly subscription prices start at ninety nine dollars a month.

05:23.420 --> 05:27.920
So to summarize you need a list of suitable keywords for your niche marketing site and you need to know

05:27.920 --> 05:31.010
the keyword difficulty or competition for each keyword.

05:31.070 --> 05:35.750
Then you can start to optimize your website and the content that you publish in line with this information

05:36.440 --> 05:38.700
domain name and web hosting.

05:38.780 --> 05:42.470
You will need to purchase a domain name and web hosting for your niche Web site.

05:42.470 --> 05:47.840
We recommend that you choose a dot com domain name and that the name has some relevance to your niche.

05:47.840 --> 05:49.960
It is very easy to register a domain name.

05:50.390 --> 05:55.640
We recommend both go Daddy dot com and name cheap dot com is high quality domain registrars for your

05:55.640 --> 05:57.080
new domain name.

05:57.080 --> 06:01.030
Both of these websites have a feature where you can check the availability of a name.

06:01.190 --> 06:06.940
So we used Go Daddy dot com and entered paleo Sage the dot com was taken.

06:06.950 --> 06:10.430
But the paleo sage dot com was available at the time of writing.

06:10.670 --> 06:15.440
This would be a good name to choose as it suggest wisdom and has the word paleo in it.

06:15.530 --> 06:20.130
A few years ago it was really important to register a domain name with your main keyword in it.

06:20.150 --> 06:25.490
These days it has very little effect if any but we would always recommend that you have a domain name

06:25.490 --> 06:29.190
that makes people feel comfortable and that they have come to the right Web site.

06:29.330 --> 06:32.490
A dot com domain name will cost you around ten dollars a year.

06:32.700 --> 06:37.460
You are effectively renting your name and you will have to renew it every year in order to create your

06:37.460 --> 06:39.330
niche Web site around your domain name.

06:39.350 --> 06:41.630
You will need a web hosting account as well.

06:41.630 --> 06:46.640
There are many companies offering Web hosting accounts from as little as three dollars a month.

06:46.670 --> 06:50.810
Some of these companies offer a free domain name with their hosting but we recommend that you go for

06:50.810 --> 06:54.050
a name from go daddy or name cheap as it is cleaner.

06:54.170 --> 07:00.080
Think long term here you're going to be creating a valuable asset a successful niche Web site can sell

07:00.080 --> 07:04.660
for a great deal of money and you do not want to be involved in a dispute with your web hosting company.

07:04.660 --> 07:06.400
If you want to sell your Web site.

07:06.560 --> 07:09.750
Here are some important things to look out for with a web host.

07:09.800 --> 07:10.950
The monthly cost.

07:11.180 --> 07:12.860
The location of the Web services.

07:12.890 --> 07:16.480
In other words USA the UK Europe Asia etc..

07:16.550 --> 07:18.520
How many domain names can you host.

07:18.590 --> 07:20.840
How much disk space will you get.

07:20.900 --> 07:23.690
How much bandwidth Internet traffic will you get.

07:23.690 --> 07:26.630
Does the Web host have WordPress one click install software.

07:27.320 --> 07:29.820
OK let's take a look at each one of these.

07:30.010 --> 07:35.380
The cost Web hosting can start from one dollar a month and rise to hundreds a month.

07:35.390 --> 07:39.650
We suggest that you choose a web host that will offer all the things in the above list for around 10

07:39.650 --> 07:43.120
to 15 dollars a month web server location.

07:43.190 --> 07:47.540
If you believe that the majority of your audience will be in the United States for example then it is

07:47.540 --> 07:49.880
best to choose a web host with servers there.

07:50.030 --> 07:54.380
Your website will load faster for your potential customers which is very important.

07:54.410 --> 07:59.450
How many domain names if your web host will only allow you to add one domain name to your hosting.

07:59.510 --> 08:03.540
Then if you want to create another Web site you will have to purchase another web hosting package.

08:03.770 --> 08:07.660
Look for a web host that offers several or even unlimited domain names.

08:07.880 --> 08:13.220
Disk space when you create a Web site you will add a number of files to your Web hosting servers.

08:13.280 --> 08:15.890
A lot of web hosts these days offer unlimited disk space.

08:15.920 --> 08:18.440
So look out for this bandwidth.

08:18.530 --> 08:22.190
Some web hosts will limit the amount of bandwidth that you can use each month.

08:22.280 --> 08:28.610
So look for web hosts that offer unlimited bandwidth one click installation of WordPress.

08:28.640 --> 08:30.740
This is very important.

08:30.890 --> 08:35.240
A lot of web hosts will have a feature where you can install the free Wordpress blogging platform on

08:35.240 --> 08:38.000
your domain name with one click of your mouse.

08:38.000 --> 08:42.490
You need this as you are going to use the word press blogging platform to create your Web site.

08:42.500 --> 08:46.010
This is different to a free Web site at WordPress dot com.

08:46.010 --> 08:49.180
We recommend host gate or dot com for your web hosting.

08:49.190 --> 08:52.730
They have been around for years and are used to dealing with Internet marketers.

08:52.730 --> 08:57.630
They have different packages available that offer unlimited domains one click install a wordpress on

08:57.630 --> 09:03.300
metered or unlimited bandwidth and disk space in USA servers for around 10 dollars a month.

09:03.320 --> 09:07.210
There are lots of other good web hosts available that can provide you with a similar deal.

09:07.430 --> 09:10.730
Search for web host comparisons in Google to learn more.

09:10.730 --> 09:14.960
Always go for a web host that has the one click WordPress install feature.

09:14.960 --> 09:19.060
Once you have registered a web hosting account you will need to point your domain name to it.

09:19.070 --> 09:23.680
There are a lot of videos on YouTube to show you how to do this and it is a lot easier than it sounds.

09:23.810 --> 09:27.670
Install Wordpress when you purchase your web hosting account.

09:27.680 --> 09:32.510
You will be provided with access to it using a special you are all Web site address.

09:32.510 --> 09:36.170
Usually you gain access using a facility called C panel.

09:36.170 --> 09:40.280
You can do a great number of things with C panel and one of the really great features is the automatic

09:40.280 --> 09:43.250
installation of the WordPress blogging platform.

09:43.250 --> 09:45.950
Usually there will be an icon and c panel for one click.

09:45.950 --> 09:47.490
WordPress installations.

09:47.750 --> 09:51.980
Click on this and then fill out the relevant details such as the name of your website and your admin

09:51.980 --> 09:52.930
address.

09:53.090 --> 09:57.490
If you need to supply a password then make sure this is strong and make a note of it.

09:57.650 --> 10:01.840
Then click install and a few seconds later your website will be ready.

10:01.850 --> 10:07.310
There are regular updates to the WordPress blogging platform and with most good hosting packages these

10:07.310 --> 10:11.040
will automatically be installed on your website which is really convenient.

10:11.040 --> 10:15.920
You always want to work with the very latest version of WordPress for security and other reasons.

10:16.050 --> 10:20.040
Why do we recommend WordPress rather than other Web site platforms.

10:20.040 --> 10:23.180
Well the main reason is that it is so easy to install and use.

10:23.220 --> 10:27.250
You don't need any technical knowledge to install and run a wordpress Web site.

10:27.300 --> 10:31.380
You can also customize your WordPress web site using themes and plugins.

10:31.380 --> 10:34.580
A theme will determine the look and feel of your Web site.

10:34.590 --> 10:38.500
There are thousands of free themes available and some premium themes too.

10:38.550 --> 10:42.870
Once you find the theme that you want you can install it with one click and then customize it to add

10:42.870 --> 10:45.040
your logo or change the color scheme.

10:45.270 --> 10:48.990
A plug in is a piece of code that will enhance the features of your WordPress Web site.

10:49.290 --> 10:55.840
For example there are good plugins for SEO such as all in one SEO which is totally free and highly recommended.

10:56.010 --> 10:59.540
You can optimize all of your web pages using this plugin.

10:59.580 --> 11:04.710
There are thousands of free plugins and premium ones too that will enhance your niche Web site so that

11:04.710 --> 11:10.170
you provide a better experience for your users and maximize your chances of getting your pages and posts

11:10.230 --> 11:12.100
ranked in the search engines.

11:12.150 --> 11:16.680
You can find out a lot more about useful WordPress plugins by performing a Google search or looking

11:16.680 --> 11:18.400
on YouTube dot com.

11:18.420 --> 11:23.840
We would certainly recommend that you install a good SEO plugin and create a content form with a plugin

11:23.900 --> 11:27.300
and check out plugins that speed up the loading of your Web site.

11:27.360 --> 11:30.670
It is so easy to create new web pages using Wordpress.

11:30.810 --> 11:33.230
You have the option to create a page or a post.

11:33.510 --> 11:36.380
It is best to use pages for static pages such as about us.

11:36.380 --> 11:41.610
Terms of conditions and other legal pages do not overlook these pages as it makes your website look

11:41.610 --> 11:46.680
more professional and Google and the other search engines will expect to see these as well for your

11:46.680 --> 11:47.400
general content.

11:47.400 --> 11:49.140
You can create posts.

11:49.140 --> 11:54.120
We always create our posts using a word processor such as Microsoft Word and then when we are happy

11:54.120 --> 11:57.020
with them we copy and paste them into a new post.

11:57.060 --> 12:02.340
You can easily add media to your post such as images and videos as a minimum we would recommend that

12:02.340 --> 12:08.400
you had at least one image to break things up a continual block of text is not appealing for your visitors.

12:08.400 --> 12:12.950
Relevant videos are always a good idea when you create a new page or post it.

12:12.960 --> 12:14.790
It will be in draft mode.

12:14.910 --> 12:18.250
It will only become live on the internet when you publish it.

12:18.300 --> 12:21.060
You can make changes to any content you have published very easily.

12:21.060 --> 12:27.120
But using the editing tools within WordPress logo and Web site header we recommend that you spend a

12:27.120 --> 12:32.180
few dollars on having a professional logo and Web site header created for your new niche Web site.

12:32.220 --> 12:36.930
If you are a graphic designer then you can create your own but if not then there are some good services

12:36.960 --> 12:39.690
on offer for this on fiver dot com.

12:39.690 --> 12:42.580
Look for designers that have a lot of positive recommendations.

12:42.630 --> 12:45.050
Tell them the name of your website in the niche.

12:45.060 --> 12:47.050
Also tell them the measurement for the header.

12:47.130 --> 12:51.780
You should be able to find this in the theme details tell the designer what style design you want and

12:51.780 --> 12:53.040
the color scheme.

12:53.040 --> 12:57.750
If you already have installed your wordpress theme then give the designer your domain name so that they

12:57.750 --> 12:59.440
can color match everything.

12:59.610 --> 13:03.800
It is really worth the effort and expense to have your own unique logo and Web site.
