Generating ideas for niche markets.

00:12.680 --> 00:17.030
In this video we will be looking at a number of ways that you can generate a list of possible niche

00:17.030 --> 00:18.880
markets that you could pursue.

00:18.890 --> 00:23.600
We want to make it very clear that you will not be deciding on your niche at this stage.

00:23.600 --> 00:28.240
A lot of newcomers to niche marketing get very excited about the prospect and skip this stage.

00:28.430 --> 00:33.590
While we understand the excitement it is not a good idea to go into a niece that you cannot be passionate

00:33.590 --> 00:36.590
about or has very little opportunity to make money.

00:36.680 --> 00:38.470
Identify your passions.

00:38.480 --> 00:42.260
There is a lot of information out there about choosing a niche market and most of them will tell you

00:42.260 --> 00:43.940
to follow your passions.

00:44.090 --> 00:49.100
If you are really passionate about something then this makes a lot of sense as you will be very motivated

00:49.100 --> 00:50.230
to make it work.

00:50.450 --> 00:51.890
But it doesn't always work.

00:52.010 --> 00:56.930
If you have a passion for a niche but the size of that niche is really small and the people in it rarely

00:56.930 --> 00:59.640
buy anything then you are just wasting your time.

00:59.930 --> 01:04.800
Finding a niche that you can get passionate about is another story and we will discuss this later on.

01:04.850 --> 01:08.790
We agree that it makes a lot of sense to enter a niche market that you are passionate about.

01:09.080 --> 01:14.630
Remember at this stage you are just compiling a list of possible niche ideas in the next video.

01:14.630 --> 01:20.660
We will look at how you can test each idea for viability so we recommend that you identify the subjects

01:20.660 --> 01:22.970
that really interest you first.

01:23.000 --> 01:25.940
What are you really passionate and knowledgeable about.

01:25.940 --> 01:30.350
Get yourself a pen and paper and start to write down the things that you are interested in.

01:30.350 --> 01:32.750
Do not make any judgments at this stage.

01:33.470 --> 01:37.040
If you find yourself struggling here then ask yourself these questions.

01:37.220 --> 01:38.990
What hobbies do I have.

01:39.020 --> 01:41.550

01:46.940 --> 01:49.160
What TV programs really interest me.

01:49.730 --> 01:52.300

01:52.340 --> 01:56.940

02:06.890 --> 02:09.510
What could I improve in my life.

02:09.530 --> 02:14.690
This is just a small sample of the questions that you can ask yourself what you are doing here is looking

02:14.720 --> 02:17.310
introspective Lee to see what really interests you.

02:17.480 --> 02:22.400
It is likely that a few things will be significantly more interesting than others such as hobbies sports

02:22.400 --> 02:23.660

Again do not make any prejudgment after spending just a few minutes doing this you should be able to

02:30.410 --> 02:32.120

Even if you have no interest in them at the moment don't worry about this.

02:50.180 --> 02:51.640
Just write the ideas down.

02:51.920 --> 02:53.610
You're going to play detective here.

02:53.750 --> 02:58.310
You need a pen and notebook or a mobile device where you can jot down or record ideas.

02:58.310 --> 03:02.840
It is best to start doing this at the beginning of a new day as you progress through your day.

Activities you participate in determine the time to stop recording these things.
