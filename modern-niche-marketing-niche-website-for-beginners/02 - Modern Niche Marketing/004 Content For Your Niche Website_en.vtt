00:10.010 --> 00:13.910
Content for your niche Web site content really is king.

00:13.960 --> 00:18.380
If you publish a low quality content on your Web site then you will turn your visitors away.

00:18.380 --> 00:22.360
If you go to a poor Web site what are the chances that you will return there again.

00:22.460 --> 00:24.020
Not a chance right.

00:24.050 --> 00:27.540
So keep this in mind when you are creating the content for your Web site.

00:27.740 --> 00:30.680
It is all about quality and not quantity.

00:30.680 --> 00:34.880
We do recommend that you publish content fairly regularly to keep your visitors and the search engines

00:34.880 --> 00:35.720
happy.

00:35.720 --> 00:39.080
The best way to do this is to develop a content plan.

00:39.080 --> 00:43.370
You can create a content plan based around the comprehensive keyword research that you did as the first

00:43.370 --> 00:45.260
step to setting up your niche Web site.

00:45.350 --> 00:49.900
When you are creating your content plan Don't worry about how you will write each piece of content.

00:49.910 --> 00:53.240
There are a number of ways to do this as we will discuss here.

00:53.330 --> 00:54.850
Write the content yourself.

00:55.040 --> 00:57.380
If you are not an expert on the content you want to write.

00:57.410 --> 01:00.240
Don't worry because you can soon become one.

01:00.260 --> 01:04.020
Just use google and find web pages that have the information that you need.

01:04.040 --> 01:08.900
Rewrite this information so it is unique and you have your post in terms of post length.

01:08.900 --> 01:12.450
We would recommend that you go for at least 500 words per post.

01:12.690 --> 01:16.610
It is a good idea to vary the amount of words that you use as this looks more natural to the search

01:16.610 --> 01:18.640
engines long posts.

01:18.650 --> 01:23.450
Fifteen hundred words and upwards do tend to rank better in search engines and shorter posts.

01:23.450 --> 01:25.600
But this is not an exact science.

01:25.610 --> 01:28.400
Think about your readers first and not the search engines.

01:28.490 --> 01:31.750
If your readers like your content they will come back for more.

01:31.850 --> 01:36.980
When you were writing your new posts always select some keywords to include and add these in a natural

01:36.980 --> 01:41.660
way determine your most important keyword and add that to the title of the post.

01:41.780 --> 01:44.510
Use the other keywords in the body of your posts.

01:44.540 --> 01:49.340
Don't overdo it with keywords and use them too often as this can be seen as keyword stuffing by the

01:49.340 --> 01:50.730
search engines.

01:50.750 --> 01:56.450
Always check your new post for uniqueness use a service like copy scape that com to check this.

01:56.450 --> 01:59.670
It is worth spending a few cents on this to ensure uniqueness.

01:59.750 --> 02:04.340
If your post is not unique then it will be difficult to ranking in Google and the other search engines

02:04.820 --> 02:09.680
outsource your content writing a lot of niche Web site owners don't want to write their own posts as

02:09.680 --> 02:14.400
they feel that they are not good at writing or they just can't be bothered to spend the time to do this.

02:14.480 --> 02:17.440
Having a good writer on board to write your posts is a good idea.

02:17.450 --> 02:22.860
As you can spend your time on generating more traffic to your website where do you find a good writer.

02:22.880 --> 02:28.010
Well there are many places you can find them such as gig based websites like 5 or dot com and people

02:28.010 --> 02:34.490
per hour dot com and project Web sites such as Upward dot com freelancer dot com and guru dot com.

02:34.490 --> 02:39.190
If you are choosing a writer for the first time then arrange a meeting via Instant Messenger with them.

02:39.410 --> 02:43.520
Tell them what you are looking for and let them tell you about their experience and send you some samples

02:43.520 --> 02:44.630
of their work.

02:44.630 --> 02:48.350
There are other Web sites where you can get articles created very cheaply.

02:48.350 --> 02:52.390
We're not going to name these Web sites here but the price charged will tell its own story.

02:52.520 --> 02:57.740
A five dollar article is likely to be written by a person whose first language is not English.

02:57.740 --> 03:02.630
Sometimes you can get lucky but most of the time you will have to contend with grammar errors and more.

03:02.690 --> 03:06.770
There are reliable professional writers on websites like the Warrior Forum.

03:06.770 --> 03:11.840
You can check their reviews before you decide one thing to note is that good writers are usually busy

03:12.050 --> 03:15.210
and you may have to wait a few days for your content to be created.

03:15.290 --> 03:20.180
Usually it is well worth the wait let your writer know the subject of your content and any keywords

03:20.180 --> 03:21.420
you want included.

03:21.470 --> 03:24.580
Also tell them what call the action you want at the end of the content.

03:24.800 --> 03:28.170
Do you want readers to join your email list or check out a product page.

03:28.280 --> 03:34.200
Once you find a good writer treat them well as they are pretty rare use PR content.

03:34.250 --> 03:36.970

03:36.980 --> 03:42.170
