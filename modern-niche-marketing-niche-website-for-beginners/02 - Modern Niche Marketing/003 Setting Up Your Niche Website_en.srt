1
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:14,670
Setting up your niche Web site before you start getting excited about setting up your new niche Web

2
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:15,040
site.

3
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:19,970
You need to think about how you're going to get targeted visitor traffic to it in a later video we will

4
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:21,880
discuss a number of ways that you can do this.

5
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:26,880
But we want to start this video off by discussing SEO Search Engine Optimization.

6
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:32,060
A lot of online marketers think that SEO is really too difficult these days with all of the changes

7
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:35,190
that Google has made to its search engine algorithm.

8
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:41,150
But this is a big mistake because it's actually easier to rank web pages now if they are optimized correctly.

9
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:44,810
So the first thing you need to do is keyword research.

10
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:48,530
The best niche websites start with comprehensive keyword research.

11
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:53,000
We have already mentioned the google keyword planner and how you can use this to identify search volumes

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,340
and related keywords for your niche.

13
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:57,540
You need to take this a step further now.

14
00:00:57,730 --> 00:01:02,210
Unique Web site needs to be organized around the different types of keywords that you uncover.

15
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:07,430
We recommend that you use the WordPress blogging platform for your niche Web site and it is very easy

16
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:09,770
to set up different categories with this.

17
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:13,120
This is what Google and the other search engines want you to do.

18
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:17,380
So you want to generate a list of as many keywords for your list as you can.

19
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:22,220
You're not going to rank your individual web pages for all these keywords but you certainly will for

20
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:27,140
some of them as your Web site grows and becomes more of an authority then you will start to rank for

21
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:29,510
some of more competitive terms.

22
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:34,640
Think about the future now SEO is not a fast traffic solution but a long term one.

23
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:39,740
You can get traffic to your niche Web site using other methods as your site develops but you always

24
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:43,340
need to have SEO as the foundation of your niche Web site.

25
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:47,630
Go to the google keyword planner and start by entering in your seed keyword.

26
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:51,530
As we said before the planner will make suggestions for related keywords.

27
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:55,930
You can then use these related keywords to find other related keywords.

28
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,330
Set aside a few hours to create your initial list of keywords.

29
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:03,350
It is not difficult to come up with hundreds of different keywords for your niche Web site.

30
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:09,110
You can export the keywords that you find from the google keyword planner in CSP format and create Microsoft

31
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:12,310
Excel or other format spreadsheets from this.

32
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:15,260
These spreadsheets will be your mastered keyword lists.

33
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:20,510
You will have a few to work keywords such as paleo diet some three word keywords such as paleo weight

34
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:26,900
loss and quite a number of four and more keywords which will be your long tail keywords the long tail

35
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:31,820
keywords will not have massive search volume but they will be a lot easier to rank for without too much

36
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:32,770
effort.

37
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:35,680
These will be the start of your free traffic from the search engines.

38
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:40,130
Search engine traffic is the very best because it is really targeted.

39
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:44,720
If someone is searching for paleo diet weight loss then this is very specific.

40
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:48,170
They are truly interested in using the paleo diet to lose weight.

41
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:52,220
Your web pages need to be in the search results for these kinds of terms so that you can provide the

42
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:57,410
answers that people are looking for and either generate a new lead for your email list or make a sale

43
00:02:57,410 --> 00:02:58,800
or a commission.

44
00:02:58,850 --> 00:03:03,890
You need to understand that every keyword that you find will have a level of search engine competitiveness.

45
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:08,030
Usually the higher the search volume the more competitive the keyword term will be.

46
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:10,070
There are exceptions of course.

47
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,910
If a keyword is very competitive it will take a very long time for you to rank high in Google and the

48
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:16,480
other search engines for it.

49
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:21,170
Personal terms such as paleo it will probably be impossible for you to rank on the first page for this

50
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:22,720
no matter what you do.

51
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:27,980
So you need to know how competitive the keywords in your list are and then determine how competitive

52
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:29,090
they are.

53
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:33,890
Please note that this is not the same as the competition column in the google keyword planner.

54
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:37,780
This is the ads competition and will not be of any use to you.

55
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:42,650
It is possible to make an assessment of keyword competition manually but this requires a lot of skill

56
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:43,760
and time.

57
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,240
Fortunately there are the ways you can do this.

58
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:48,820
Here are the two methods that we recommend.

59
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:55,520
Traffic Travis this is a really great SEO tool used by the professionals but very few niche marketers.

60
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:58,650
You can download a free version at traffic Travis dot com.

61
00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:02,930
The software does a lot of great things for SEO but one of the most valuable is that it will tell you

62
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:05,010
the competitiveness of keywords.

63
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:08,580
We recommend that you download the free version and give it a try first.

64
00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:13,250
You can only look at a few keywords a day with the free version but you can see if you like the software

65
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:18,100
and then decide on whether or not to purchase the professional version at around ninety seven dollars.

66
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:23,450
When you use traffic Travis to estimate the FCO competition of a keyword it will tell you what it believes

67
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:25,180
to be the level of difficulty.

68
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:34,040
This is the range easy relatively easy medium difficult very difficult extremely difficult.

69
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:38,540
Anything that is easy relatively easy or medium is fair game.

70
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,380
The others will take a lot more work.

71
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:44,150
Traffic Travis queries Google several times to estimate keyword difficulty.

72
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:46,630
And lately Google has placed restrictions on this.

73
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:50,330
So analyzing hundreds of terms at once isn't possible anymore.

74
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:51,870
A ref scam.

75
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:53,920
This is a paid subscription service.

76
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:59,450
They do have an offer for seven dollars for seven days at the time of writing at a ref dot com a refs

77
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:04,700
is the king of the FCO analysis programs that will provide more accurate and up to date information

78
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:07,100
than any of the other programs out there.

79
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:11,810
It also has feature to measure keyword difficulty in a similar way to traffic Travis.

80
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:16,550
The difference is that a refs has all of this information already stored so there is no waiting for

81
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:17,680
the results.

82
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:23,350
If you are serious about SEO then the monthly subscription prices start at ninety nine dollars a month.

83
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:27,920
So to summarize you need a list of suitable keywords for your niche marketing site and you need to know

84
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:31,010
the keyword difficulty or competition for each keyword.

85
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:35,750
Then you can start to optimize your website and the content that you publish in line with this information

86
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,700
domain name and web hosting.

87
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:42,470
You will need to purchase a domain name and web hosting for your niche Web site.

88
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:47,840
We recommend that you choose a dot com domain name and that the name has some relevance to your niche.

89
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,960
It is very easy to register a domain name.

90
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:55,640
We recommend both go Daddy dot com and name cheap dot com is high quality domain registrars for your

91
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:57,080
new domain name.

92
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:01,030
Both of these websites have a feature where you can check the availability of a name.

93
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:06,940
So we used Go Daddy dot com and entered paleo Sage the dot com was taken.

94
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:10,430
But the paleo sage dot com was available at the time of writing.

95
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:15,440
This would be a good name to choose as it suggest wisdom and has the word paleo in it.

96
00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:20,130
A few years ago it was really important to register a domain name with your main keyword in it.

97
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:25,490
These days it has very little effect if any but we would always recommend that you have a domain name

98
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:29,190
that makes people feel comfortable and that they have come to the right Web site.

99
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:32,490
A dot com domain name will cost you around ten dollars a year.

100
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:37,460
You are effectively renting your name and you will have to renew it every year in order to create your

101
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:39,330
niche Web site around your domain name.

102
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:41,630
You will need a web hosting account as well.

103
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:46,640
There are many companies offering Web hosting accounts from as little as three dollars a month.

104
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:50,810
Some of these companies offer a free domain name with their hosting but we recommend that you go for

105
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:54,050
a name from go daddy or name cheap as it is cleaner.

106
00:06:54,170 --> 00:07:00,080
Think long term here you're going to be creating a valuable asset a successful niche Web site can sell

107
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:04,660
for a great deal of money and you do not want to be involved in a dispute with your web hosting company.

108
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:06,400
If you want to sell your Web site.

109
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,750
Here are some important things to look out for with a web host.

110
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:10,950
The monthly cost.

111
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:12,860
The location of the Web services.

112
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:16,480
In other words USA the UK Europe Asia etc..

113
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:18,520
How many domain names can you host.

114
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:20,840
How much disk space will you get.

115
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:23,690
How much bandwidth Internet traffic will you get.

116
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:26,630
Does the Web host have WordPress one click install software.

117
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:29,820
OK let's take a look at each one of these.

118
00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:35,380
The cost Web hosting can start from one dollar a month and rise to hundreds a month.

119
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:39,650
We suggest that you choose a web host that will offer all the things in the above list for around 10

120
00:07:39,650 --> 00:07:43,120
to 15 dollars a month web server location.

121
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:47,540
If you believe that the majority of your audience will be in the United States for example then it is

122
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:49,880
best to choose a web host with servers there.

123
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:54,380
Your website will load faster for your potential customers which is very important.

124
00:07:54,410 --> 00:07:59,450
How many domain names if your web host will only allow you to add one domain name to your hosting.

125
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:03,540
Then if you want to create another Web site you will have to purchase another web hosting package.

126
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:07,660
Look for a web host that offers several or even unlimited domain names.

127
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:13,220
Disk space when you create a Web site you will add a number of files to your Web hosting servers.

128
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,890
A lot of web hosts these days offer unlimited disk space.

129
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:18,440
So look out for this bandwidth.

130
00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:22,190
Some web hosts will limit the amount of bandwidth that you can use each month.

131
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:28,610
So look for web hosts that offer unlimited bandwidth one click installation of WordPress.

132
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,740
This is very important.

133
00:08:30,890 --> 00:08:35,240
A lot of web hosts will have a feature where you can install the free Wordpress blogging platform on

134
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:38,000
your domain name with one click of your mouse.

135
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,490
You need this as you are going to use the word press blogging platform to create your Web site.

136
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:46,010
This is different to a free Web site at WordPress dot com.

137
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:49,180
We recommend host gate or dot com for your web hosting.

138
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:52,730
They have been around for years and are used to dealing with Internet marketers.

139
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:57,630
They have different packages available that offer unlimited domains one click install a wordpress on

140
00:08:57,630 --> 00:09:03,300
metered or unlimited bandwidth and disk space in USA servers for around 10 dollars a month.

141
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:07,210
There are lots of other good web hosts available that can provide you with a similar deal.

142
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:10,730
Search for web host comparisons in Google to learn more.

143
00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:14,960
Always go for a web host that has the one click WordPress install feature.

144
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:19,060
Once you have registered a web hosting account you will need to point your domain name to it.

145
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:23,680
There are a lot of videos on YouTube to show you how to do this and it is a lot easier than it sounds.

146
00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:27,670
Install Wordpress when you purchase your web hosting account.

147
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:32,510
You will be provided with access to it using a special you are all Web site address.

148
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:36,170
Usually you gain access using a facility called C panel.

149
00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:40,280
You can do a great number of things with C panel and one of the really great features is the automatic

150
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:43,250
installation of the WordPress blogging platform.

151
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:45,950
Usually there will be an icon and c panel for one click.

152
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:47,490
WordPress installations.

153
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:51,980
Click on this and then fill out the relevant details such as the name of your website and your admin

154
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:52,930
address.

155
00:09:53,090 --> 00:09:57,490
If you need to supply a password then make sure this is strong and make a note of it.

156
00:09:57,650 --> 00:10:01,840
Then click install and a few seconds later your website will be ready.

157
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:07,310
There are regular updates to the WordPress blogging platform and with most good hosting packages these

158
00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:11,040
will automatically be installed on your website which is really convenient.

159
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:15,920
You always want to work with the very latest version of WordPress for security and other reasons.

160
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:20,040
Why do we recommend WordPress rather than other Web site platforms.

161
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:23,180
Well the main reason is that it is so easy to install and use.

162
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:27,250
You don't need any technical knowledge to install and run a wordpress Web site.

163
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:31,380
You can also customize your WordPress web site using themes and plugins.

164
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:34,580
A theme will determine the look and feel of your Web site.

00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:38,500
There are thousands of free themes available and some premium themes too.

166
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:42,870
Once you find the theme that you want you can install it with one click and then customize it to add

167
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:45,040
your logo or change the color scheme.

168
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:48,990
A plug in is a piece of code that will enhance the features of your WordPress Web site.

169
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:55,840
For example there are good plugins for SEO such as all in one SEO which is totally free and highly recommended.

170
00:10:56,010 --> 00:10:59,540
You can optimize all of your web pages using this plugin.

171

00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:10,170

173
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:12,100
ranked in the search engines.

174
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:16,680
You can find out a lot more about useful WordPress plugins by performing a Google search or looking

175
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,400
on YouTube dot com.

176
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:23,840
We would certainly recommend that you install a good SEO plugin and create a content form with a plugin

177
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:27,300
and check out plugins that speed up the loading of your Web site.

178
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,670
It is so easy to create new web pages using Wordpress.

179
00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:33,230
You have the option to create a page or a post.

180
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:36,380
It is best to use pages for static pages such as about us.

181
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:41,610
Terms of conditions and other legal pages do not overlook these pages as it makes your website look

182
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:46,680
more professional and Google and the other search engines will expect to see these as well for your

183
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:47,400
general content.

184
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,140
You can create posts.

185
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:54,120
We always create our posts using a word processor such as Microsoft Word and then when we are happy

186
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:57,020
with them we copy and paste them into a new post.

187
00:11:57,060 --> 00:12:02,340
You can easily add media to your post such as images and videos as a minimum we would recommend that

188
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:08,400
you had at least one image to break things up a continual block of text is not appealing for your visitors.

189
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:12,950
Relevant videos are always a good idea when you create a new page or post it.

190
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,790
It will be in draft mode.

191
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:18,250
It will only become live on the internet when you publish it.

192
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:21,060
You can make changes to any content you have published very easily.

193
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:27,120
But using the editing tools within WordPress logo and Web site header we recommend that you spend a

194
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:32,180
few dollars on having a professional logo and Web site header created for your new niche Web site.

195
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:36,930
If you are a graphic designer then you can create your own but if not then there are some good services

196
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:39,690
on offer for this on fiver dot com.

197
00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:42,580
Look for designers that have a lot of positive recommendations.

198
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:45,050
Tell them the name of your website in the niche.

199
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:47,050
Also tell them the measurement for the header.

200
00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:51,780
You should be able to find this in the theme details tell the designer what style design you want and

201
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:53,040
the color scheme.

202
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:57,750
If you already have installed your wordpress theme then give the designer your domain name so that they

203
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:59,440
can color match everything.

204
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:03,800
It is really worth the effort and expense to have your own unique logo and Web site.
