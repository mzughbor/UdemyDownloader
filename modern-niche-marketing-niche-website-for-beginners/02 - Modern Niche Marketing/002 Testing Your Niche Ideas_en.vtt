00:10.020 --> 00:11.960
Testing your niche ideas.

00:12.030 --> 00:12.420
OK.

00:12.450 --> 00:14.960
So you now have a list of niche market ideas.

00:15.000 --> 00:19.470
The next step is to test the ideas to see if they are likely to be profitable for you.

00:19.470 --> 00:24.720
There are two very important elements to this which are demand and commercial intent.

00:24.720 --> 00:26.280
Demand is very important.

00:26.400 --> 00:28.870
You do not want to go for a niche that is very small.

00:28.950 --> 00:32.820
If you are not getting a good number of targeted visitors to your website then you are not going to

00:32.820 --> 00:33.570
make much money.

00:33.660 --> 00:37.080
If anything at all you need targeted visitors.

00:37.080 --> 00:39.960
These are people that have an interest in your chosen niche.

00:39.990 --> 00:44.220
This is cost effective and will increase your chances of achieving conversions.

00:44.220 --> 00:47.430
Don't be tempted to purchase broad traffic for your niche.

00:47.430 --> 00:52.230
There are a lot of vendors selling traffic from specific countries but this will just be a waste of

00:52.230 --> 00:53.100
money.

00:53.100 --> 00:55.890
The other important aspect is commercial intent.

00:55.920 --> 01:00.520
If the niche is large but nobody spends money in it then you need to forget about it.

01:00.570 --> 01:03.050
It doesn't matter if you have a real passion for the niche.

01:03.120 --> 01:06.840
If there is no money to be made then you are just wasting your time.

01:06.870 --> 01:09.590
You need to take the emotion out of your decision here.

01:09.630 --> 01:13.840
It is possible that the best niche on your list is something that you don't know much about.

01:13.860 --> 01:18.510
You need to ask yourself if you could get interested and passionate about it especially if it was to

01:18.510 --> 01:19.970
make you a lot of money.

01:20.080 --> 01:25.450
Niche size it is fairly easy and quick to see whether your niche is large enough or not.

01:25.530 --> 01:31.530
Just use the google keyword planner tool at ads that Google that come forward slash home or slash tools

01:31.890 --> 01:35.430
for Slash keyword hyphen planner to use the planner.

01:35.520 --> 01:37.830
You will need a free Google AdWords account.

01:37.830 --> 01:40.950
This doesn't mean that you have to spend any money on Google ads.

01:40.950 --> 01:44.740
You can if you want to but it is not necessary at this stage.

01:44.760 --> 01:48.500
You need to decide on a good seed keyword for your niche ideas.

01:48.630 --> 01:52.920
Let's use an example here in your list of niche ideas you have the paleo diet.

01:53.520 --> 01:58.710
So the seed keyword that we will use for our example is Paleo diet.

01:58.740 --> 02:01.280
Enter this into the google keyword planner.

02:01.410 --> 02:06.120
One of the great things about the google keyword planner is that it will provide you with related keyword

02:06.120 --> 02:10.940
suggestions and show you the estimated search volumes at the time of writing.

02:10.950 --> 02:13.690
We found the following Paleo diet.

02:13.810 --> 02:20.700
One hundred thousand and one million monthly searches paleo diet foods one thousand ten 10000 Paleo

02:20.700 --> 02:26.740
Meal plan one thousand and ten thousand paleo diet plan one thousand ten thousand.

02:26.790 --> 02:38.070
The paleo diet 1000 10000 paleo weight loss 1000 10000 paleo diet weight loss 1000 10000 paleo diet

02:38.070 --> 02:40.640
basics 1000 to 10000.

02:41.040 --> 02:45.890
There were more keyword terms and this indicates that there is good search volume in this niche.

02:45.900 --> 02:49.420
This is certainly a niche market idea worth pursuing further.

02:49.500 --> 02:53.690
You can use the google keyword planner to check all of your niche ideas quickly.

02:53.790 --> 02:55.670
What is the best size of niche.

02:55.680 --> 03:01.410
Well there is no hard and fast rule but we would recommend that the C keyword has a minimum of ten thousand

03:01.410 --> 03:03.510
searches a month for it to be viable.

03:03.510 --> 03:08.970
In our example paleo diet easily exceeds this with between one hundred thousand and one million every

03:08.970 --> 03:09.630
month.

03:09.840 --> 03:13.190
The numbers above are the estimated search finds for the USA.

03:13.200 --> 03:17.490
You can change this to make it worldwide where the numbers are usually going to be larger.

03:17.550 --> 03:22.860
If you only intend to market to a specific country then you can choose this in the google keyword planner

03:22.980 --> 03:25.680
to get the most accurate search volume.

03:25.710 --> 03:29.360
We recommend that you go for niche markets that have global appeal.

03:29.430 --> 03:33.620
The paleo diet certainly fits the bill as it is popular all over the world.

03:33.630 --> 03:36.360
Why limit your options if you don't need to.

03:36.360 --> 03:39.510
There are other keyword tools that you can use for this research.

03:39.510 --> 03:43.520
But the google keyword planner is always likely to be the most accurate.

03:43.530 --> 03:45.330
It is easy to use and free.

03:45.330 --> 03:48.510
So it is not worth using anything else in our opinion.

03:48.510 --> 03:49.970
COMMERCIAL INTENT.

03:50.190 --> 03:55.350
OK so you have run all of your niche ideas through the google keyword planner and eliminated those were

03:55.350 --> 03:57.450
the sizes the nation's too small.

03:57.480 --> 04:01.200
The next step is to check for commercial intent at this point.

04:01.200 --> 04:04.920
We want to make the distinction between physical and digital products.

04:04.920 --> 04:09.690
You can become an affiliate for Amazon and promote their physical products physical products tend to

04:09.690 --> 04:11.810
sell more easily than digital products.

04:12.030 --> 04:16.090
But the commissions you can earn as an affiliate are usually a lot lower.

04:16.320 --> 04:21.310
As a new Amazon affiliate you will earn just 4 percent commission on physical products.

04:21.330 --> 04:25.260
This can amount to a few cents or a few dollars depending on the price of the product.

04:25.290 --> 04:29.790
It is a good idea to target high ticket items at Amazon if you want to make good money.

04:29.790 --> 04:34.510
A good example of this is flat screen TV ads which sell for 1000 dollars and upwards.

04:34.620 --> 04:37.940
Digital products are guides videos and software.

04:38.010 --> 04:41.940
They are something that the customer can instantly download or have access to once they have made their

04:41.940 --> 04:45.750
purchase because it is usually more difficult to sell digital products.

04:45.750 --> 04:49.440
The commissions are higher ranging from 30 percent to 100 percent.

04:49.440 --> 04:54.750
Normally you can expect the 50 percent commission on digital products to make money online niche.

04:54.750 --> 05:00.150
There are some examples of low price products offering 100 percent commission usually digital products

05:00.150 --> 05:03.930
will be in a funnel which we will cover in more detail later.

05:03.930 --> 05:09.260
The best niche market ideas have both physical and digital product opportunities there are lots of products

05:09.260 --> 05:14.120
of both types available for you to make a commission on some niche ideas will only have physical products

05:14.120 --> 05:16.750
available and some only digital products.

05:16.760 --> 05:23.060
This is fine as long as people within the niche you're buying using Amazon you can use Amazon to see

05:23.060 --> 05:25.590
if there's commercial intent for your niche ideas.

05:25.700 --> 05:29.420
Just go to Amazon.com and then enter your seed keyword.

05:29.420 --> 05:32.410
So let's continue with our example of Paleo diet.

05:32.450 --> 05:37.330
There are not going to be a lot of physical products for the paleo diet as it is all about food choices.

05:37.370 --> 05:41.790
What we did find is a lot of books and some of them with a high number of reviews.

05:41.960 --> 05:46.160
The review can as important as people that actually buy the products leave them.

05:46.160 --> 05:50.990
It is generally accepted that a single review on Amazon means that at least 10 people purchase the product

05:51.500 --> 05:53.590
and as many as a thousand.

05:53.600 --> 05:55.790
Only a small number of people will leave a review.

05:55.790 --> 06:01.450
So if there are hundreds or even thousands of reviews then this is a good sign of commercial intent.

06:01.610 --> 06:06.260
So run the remaining he said yes through Amazon and look out for review numbers.

06:06.260 --> 06:10.640
Ideally you want at least 100 reviews for a product to suggest good commercial intent.

06:10.640 --> 06:15.800
There will be related products as well and you can check the review numbers for these two using click

06:15.800 --> 06:16.790
bank.

06:16.790 --> 06:20.270
As you know click bank is the number one marketplace for digital products.

06:20.420 --> 06:25.330
So go to click bank dot com and into your seed keyword in the affiliate marketplace section.

06:25.370 --> 06:29.420
The first thing to do is note the number of products available for Paleo diet.

06:29.420 --> 06:34.580
There were over 40 products available at the time of writing which is a good sign of commercial intent.

06:34.580 --> 06:38.470
You can refine your search by changing the results to show the highest gravity.

06:38.480 --> 06:43.430
This is a measure of the number of sales of a particular product by affiliates in the last week.

06:43.430 --> 06:48.440
The top paleo diet product and click bank has a gravity of over sixty five and there are others with

06:48.440 --> 06:50.320
the gravity of around 50.

06:50.330 --> 06:54.200
This is all good as it shows sales are happening in this niche.

06:54.200 --> 06:59.930
Google search another good test to see if a niche has commercial intent is to check for Google ads when

06:59.930 --> 07:01.330
performing a Google search.

07:01.850 --> 07:07.140
So we use Google to perform a search for paleo diet and found a number of ads.

07:07.160 --> 07:11.350
You can also check this using the google keyword planner when you get the results back.

07:11.360 --> 07:13.940
You will see a column called competition.

07:13.940 --> 07:15.490
This is the competition for ads.

07:15.500 --> 07:18.200
And if you see examples of medium or high competition.

07:18.380 --> 07:21.130
This means that money is being spent on ads.

07:21.320 --> 07:27.350
Google ads are not cheap and you can easily pay one dollar and upwards a click for the best keyword

07:27.350 --> 07:28.290
terms.

07:28.460 --> 07:32.960
Advertisers would not be spending this money if there was no commercial intent in their niche.

07:33.230 --> 07:38.480
Other commercial intent methods there are a number of affiliate networks where you can find out which

07:38.480 --> 07:44.360
products are selling well two of the most popular networks are commission junction and share a sale.

07:44.390 --> 07:50.240
Both of these networks have analytics to show you the best APC earnings per click values and network

07:50.240 --> 07:51.350
earnings.

07:51.410 --> 07:56.730
It is not essential that you use these networks to validate the commercial intent of your niche ideas.

07:56.810 --> 07:59.710
They are just useful to further validate an idea.

07:59.780 --> 08:03.980
You will need to become a member of Commission Junction to use their analytics and this will not be

08:03.980 --> 08:05.140
possible at this stage.

08:05.150 --> 08:10.160
If you don't have a niche Web site set up yet another way of monetizing your niche Web site is by promoting

08:10.160 --> 08:12.800
CPA cost per action offers.

08:13.010 --> 08:17.300
Usually these offers will pay small commissions to you for your visitors providing specific details

08:17.300 --> 08:19.300
such as an email address.

08:19.340 --> 08:22.370
This is much easier than making a salable product.

08:22.370 --> 08:27.380
If you are interested in the concept of CPA you can check what offers are available using a very useful

08:27.380 --> 08:30.350
Web site called offer vault dot com.

08:30.350 --> 08:34.730
All you need to do here is to enter your seed keyword into the search box and you will see all of the

08:34.730 --> 08:37.060
relevant CPA offers displayed.

08:37.190 --> 08:41.730
You can check Facebook and other social platforms to see if groups exist for your niche ideas.

08:41.750 --> 08:45.570
Just log into Facebook and then perform a search using your seed keyword.

08:45.650 --> 08:50.920
When we used paleo diet to search we found a number of Facebook groups with lots of members.

08:50.960 --> 08:54.950
Try this out for other platforms such as Reddit Pinterest and Instagram.

08:54.950 --> 08:57.710
Have a look for forums around the niche ideas.

08:57.710 --> 09:02.240
If there are a number of forums and they are active then this is a good sign that there is a lot of

09:02.240 --> 09:07.730
interest in a niche you can dig deeper to find if there are passionate posts and particular problems

09:07.730 --> 09:09.940
where you could provide a commercial solution.

09:10.070 --> 09:16.190
Time to decide at this stage you should have a small number of niche ideas left on your list by performing

09:16.190 --> 09:21.590
the tests outlined above you have verified these as being a good size and having commercial intent.

09:21.590 --> 09:24.230
So how do you choose a niche idea to get started.

09:24.230 --> 09:28.190
Well the first thing we would recommend is that you go through the smallest and write down how you feel

09:28.190 --> 09:29.650
about each one.

09:29.690 --> 09:32.420
Are you already interested or passionate about any of them.

09:32.570 --> 09:35.260
Could you develop a strong interest in any of them.

09:35.270 --> 09:40.670
Let's say that you are now left with two or three ideas what you could do is to test each of them in

09:40.670 --> 09:41.910
a small way.

09:41.930 --> 09:44.990
This will involve setting up a small website for each initial idea.

09:45.170 --> 09:50.540
You will need to add some content say three articles on each which will have a call to action to a product

09:50.540 --> 09:52.710
or service that you are an affiliate for.

09:53.030 --> 09:58.160
Sign up for Google AdWords and run ads for each niche minimum 100 clicks prudish.

09:58.400 --> 10:02.900
At the end of this you can analyze the results to see if you made any commissions or achieved any email

10:02.900 --> 10:04.280
list sign ups etc..

10:04.630 --> 10:09.930
Ok now that you've decided on the niche you will go for it is time to set up your first niche website

10:10.260 --> 10:12.480
which we will take you through in the next video.
