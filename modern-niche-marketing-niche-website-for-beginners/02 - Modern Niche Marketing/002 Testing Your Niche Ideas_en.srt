1
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:11,960
Testing your niche ideas.

2
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:12,420
OK.

3
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:14,960
So you now have a list of niche market ideas.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,470
The next step is to test the ideas to see if they are likely to be profitable for you.

5
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:24,720
There are two very important elements to this which are demand and commercial intent.

6
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,280
Demand is very important.

7
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,870
You do not want to go for a niche that is very small.

8
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:32,820
If you are not getting a good number of targeted visitors to your website then you are not going to

9
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:33,570
make much money.

10
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:37,080
If anything at all you need targeted visitors.

11
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:39,960
These are people that have an interest in your chosen niche.

12
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:44,220
This is cost effective and will increase your chances of achieving conversions.

13
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:47,430
Don't be tempted to purchase broad traffic for your niche.

14
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:52,230
There are a lot of vendors selling traffic from specific countries but this will just be a waste of

15
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:53,100
money.

16
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:55,890
The other important aspect is commercial intent.

17
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,520
If the niche is large but nobody spends money in it then you need to forget about it.

18
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:03,050
It doesn't matter if you have a real passion for the niche.

19
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:06,840
If there is no money to be made then you are just wasting your time.

20
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:09,590
You need to take the emotion out of your decision here.

21
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:13,840
It is possible that the best niche on your list is something that you don't know much about.

22
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:18,510
You need to ask yourself if you could get interested and passionate about it especially if it was to

23
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:19,970
make you a lot of money.

24
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:25,450
Niche size it is fairly easy and quick to see whether your niche is large enough or not.

25
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:31,530
Just use the google keyword planner tool at ads that Google that come forward slash home or slash tools

26
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:35,430
for Slash keyword hyphen planner to use the planner.

27
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,830
You will need a free Google AdWords account.

28
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:40,950
This doesn't mean that you have to spend any money on Google ads.

29
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:44,740
You can if you want to but it is not necessary at this stage.

30
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:48,500
You need to decide on a good seed keyword for your niche ideas.

31
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:52,920
Let's use an example here in your list of niche ideas you have the paleo diet.

32
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:58,710
So the seed keyword that we will use for our example is Paleo diet.

33
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:01,280
Enter this into the google keyword planner.

34
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:06,120
One of the great things about the google keyword planner is that it will provide you with related keyword

35
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:10,940
suggestions and show you the estimated search volumes at the time of writing.

36
00:02:10,949 --> 00:02:13,690
We found the following Paleo diet.

37
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:20,700
One hundred thousand and one million monthly searches paleo diet foods one thousand ten 10000 Paleo

38
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:26,740
Meal plan one thousand and ten thousand paleo diet plan one thousand ten thousand.

39
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:38,070
The paleo diet 1000 10000 paleo weight loss 1000 10000 paleo diet weight loss 1000 10000 paleo diet

40
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:40,640
basics 1000 to 10000.

41
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:45,890
There were more keyword terms and this indicates that there is good search volume in this niche.

42
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:49,420
This is certainly a niche market idea worth pursuing further.

43
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:53,690
You can use the google keyword planner to check all of your niche ideas quickly.

44
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:55,670
What is the best size of niche.

45
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:01,410
Well there is no hard and fast rule but we would recommend that the C keyword has a minimum of ten thousand

46
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:03,510
searches a month for it to be viable.

47
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:08,970
In our example paleo diet easily exceeds this with between one hundred thousand and one million every

48
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:09,630
month.

49
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,190
The numbers above are the estimated search finds for the USA.

50
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:17,490
You can change this to make it worldwide where the numbers are usually going to be larger.

51
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:22,860
If you only intend to market to a specific country then you can choose this in the google keyword planner

52
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:25,680
to get the most accurate search volume.

53
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:29,360
We recommend that you go for niche markets that have global appeal.

54
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:33,620
The paleo diet certainly fits the bill as it is popular all over the world.

55
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:36,360
Why limit your options if you don't need to.

56
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:39,510
There are other keyword tools that you can use for this research.

57
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:43,520
But the google keyword planner is always likely to be the most accurate.

58
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:45,330
It is easy to use and free.

59
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:48,510
So it is not worth using anything else in our opinion.

60
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:49,970
COMMERCIAL INTENT.

61
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:55,350
OK so you have run all of your niche ideas through the google keyword planner and eliminated those were

62
00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:57,450
the sizes the nation's too small.

63
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:01,200
The next step is to check for commercial intent at this point.

64
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,920
We want to make the distinction between physical and digital products.

65
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:09,690
You can become an affiliate for Amazon and promote their physical products physical products tend to

66
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:11,810
sell more easily than digital products.

67
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:16,089
But the commissions you can earn as an affiliate are usually a lot lower.

68
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:21,310
As a new Amazon affiliate you will earn just 4 percent commission on physical products.

69
00:04:21,329 --> 00:04:25,260
This can amount to a few cents or a few dollars depending on the price of the product.

70
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:29,790
It is a good idea to target high ticket items at Amazon if you want to make good money.

71
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:34,510
A good example of this is flat screen TV ads which sell for 1000 dollars and upwards.

72
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:37,940
Digital products are guides videos and software.

73
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:41,940
They are something that the customer can instantly download or have access to once they have made their

74
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:45,750
purchase because it is usually more difficult to sell digital products.

75
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:49,440
The commissions are higher ranging from 30 percent to 100 percent.

76
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:54,750
Normally you can expect the 50 percent commission on digital products to make money online niche.

77
00:04:54,750 --> 00:05:00,150
There are some examples of low price products offering 100 percent commission usually digital products

78
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:03,930
will be in a funnel which we will cover in more detail later.

79
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:09,260
The best niche market ideas have both physical and digital product opportunities there are lots of products

80
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:14,120
of both types available for you to make a commission on some niche ideas will only have physical products

81
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:16,750
available and some only digital products.

82
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:23,060
This is fine as long as people within the niche you're buying using Amazon you can use Amazon to see

83
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:25,590
if there's commercial intent for your niche ideas.

84
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:29,420
Just go to Amazon.com and then enter your seed keyword.

85
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:32,410
So let's continue with our example of Paleo diet.

86
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:37,330
There are not going to be a lot of physical products for the paleo diet as it is all about food choices.

87
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:41,790
What we did find is a lot of books and some of them with a high number of reviews.

88
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:46,160
The review can as important as people that actually buy the products leave them.

89
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:50,990
It is generally accepted that a single review on Amazon means that at least 10 people purchase the product

90
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,590
and as many as a thousand.

91
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,790
Only a small number of people will leave a review.

92
00:05:55,790 --> 00:06:01,450
So if there are hundreds or even thousands of reviews then this is a good sign of commercial intent.

93
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:06,260
So run the remaining he said yes through Amazon and look out for review numbers.

94
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:10,640
Ideally you want at least 100 reviews for a product to suggest good commercial intent.

95
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:15,800
There will be related products as well and you can check the review numbers for these two using click

96
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,790
bank.

97
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:20,270
As you know click bank is the number one marketplace for digital products.

98
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:25,330
So go to click bank dot com and into your seed keyword in the affiliate marketplace section.

99
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:29,420
The first thing to do is note the number of products available for Paleo diet.

100
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:34,580
There were over 40 products available at the time of writing which is a good sign of commercial intent.

101
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:38,470
You can refine your search by changing the results to show the highest gravity.

102
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:43,430
This is a measure of the number of sales of a particular product by affiliates in the last week.

103
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:48,440
The top paleo diet product and click bank has a gravity of over sixty five and there are others with

104
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:50,320
the gravity of around 50.

105
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:54,200
This is all good as it shows sales are happening in this niche.

106
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:59,930
Google search another good test to see if a niche has commercial intent is to check for Google ads when

107
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:01,330
performing a Google search.

108
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:07,140
So we use Google to perform a search for paleo diet and found a number of ads.

109
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:11,350
You can also check this using the google keyword planner when you get the results back.

110
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,940
You will see a column called competition.

111
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:15,490
This is the competition for ads.

112
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:18,200
And if you see examples of medium or high competition.

113
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:21,130
This means that money is being spent on ads.

114
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:27,350
Google ads are not cheap and you can easily pay one dollar and upwards a click for the best keyword

115
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:28,290
terms.

116
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:32,960
Advertisers would not be spending this money if there was no commercial intent in their niche.

117
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:38,480
Other commercial intent methods there are a number of affiliate networks where you can find out which

118
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:44,360
products are selling well two of the most popular networks are commission junction and share a sale.

119
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:50,240
Both of these networks have analytics to show you the best APC earnings per click values and network

120
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,350
earnings.

121
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:56,730
It is not essential that you use these networks to validate the commercial intent of your niche ideas.

122
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:59,710
They are just useful to further validate an idea.

123
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:03,980
You will need to become a member of Commission Junction to use their analytics and this will not be

124
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:05,140
possible at this stage.

125
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:10,160
If you don't have a niche Web site set up yet another way of monetizing your niche Web site is by promoting

126
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,800
CPA cost per action offers.

127
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:17,300
Usually these offers will pay small commissions to you for your visitors providing specific details

128
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:19,300
such as an email address.

129
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:22,370
This is much easier than making a salable product.

130
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:27,380
If you are interested in the concept of CPA you can check what offers are available using a very useful

131
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:30,350
Web site called offer vault dot com.

132
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:34,730
All you need to do here is to enter your seed keyword into the search box and you will see all of the

133
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:37,059
relevant CPA offers displayed.

134
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:41,730
You can check Facebook and other social platforms to see if groups exist for your niche ideas.

135
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:45,570
Just log into Facebook and then perform a search using your seed keyword.

136
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:50,920
When we used paleo diet to search we found a number of Facebook groups with lots of members.

137
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:54,950
Try this out for other platforms such as Reddit Pinterest and Instagram.

138
00:08:54,950 --> 00:08:57,710
Have a look for forums around the niche ideas.

139
00:08:57,710 --> 00:09:02,240
If there are a number of forums and they are active then this is a good sign that there is a lot of

140
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:07,730
interest in a niche you can dig deeper to find if there are passionate posts and particular problems

141
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:09,940
where you could provide a commercial solution.

142
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:16,190
Time to decide at this stage you should have a small number of niche ideas left on your list by performing

143
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:21,590
the tests outlined above you have verified these as being a good size and having commercial intent.

144
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:24,230
So how do you choose a niche idea to get started.

145
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:28,190
Well the first thing we would recommend is that you go through the smallest and write down how you feel

146
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:29,650
about each one.

147
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:32,420
Are you already interested or passionate about any of them.

148
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:35,260
Could you develop a strong interest in any of them.

149
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:40,670
Let's say that you are now left with two or three ideas what you could do is to test each of them in

150
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:41,910
a small way.

151
00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:44,990
This will involve setting up a small website for each initial idea.

152
00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:50,540
You will need to add some content say three articles on each which will have a call to action to a product

153
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:52,710
or service that you are an affiliate for.

154
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:58,160
Sign up for Google AdWords and run ads for each niche minimum 100 clicks prudish.

155
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:02,900
At the end of this you can analyze the results to see if you made any commissions or achieved any email

156
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:04,280
list sign ups etc..

157
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:09,930
Ok now that you've decided on the niche you will go for it is time to set up your first niche website

158
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:12,480
which we will take you through in the next video.
