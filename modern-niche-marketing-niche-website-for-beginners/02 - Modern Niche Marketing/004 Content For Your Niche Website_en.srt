1
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:13,910
Content for your niche Web site content really is king.

2
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:18,380
If you publish a low quality content on your Web site then you will turn your visitors away.

3
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:22,360
If you go to a poor Web site what are the chances that you will return there again.

4
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:24,020
Not a chance right.

5
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:27,540
So keep this in mind when you are creating the content for your Web site.

6
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:30,680
It is all about quality and not quantity.

7
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:34,880
We do recommend that you publish content fairly regularly to keep your visitors and the search engines

8
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:35,720
happy.

9
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:39,080
The best way to do this is to develop a content plan.

10
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:43,370
You can create a content plan based around the comprehensive keyword research that you did as the first

11
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:45,260
step to setting up your niche Web site.

12
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:49,900
When you are creating your content plan Don't worry about how you will write each piece of content.

13
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:53,240
There are a number of ways to do this as we will discuss here.

14
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:54,850
Write the content yourself.

15
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:57,380
If you are not an expert on the content you want to write.

16
00:00:57,410 --> 00:01:00,240
Don't worry because you can soon become one.

17
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:04,019
Just use google and find web pages that have the information that you need.

18
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:08,900
Rewrite this information so it is unique and you have your post in terms of post length.

19
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:12,450
We would recommend that you go for at least 500 words per post.

20
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:16,610
It is a good idea to vary the amount of words that you use as this looks more natural to the search

21
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:18,640
engines long posts.

22
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:23,450
Fifteen hundred words and upwards do tend to rank better in search engines and shorter posts.

23
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:25,600
But this is not an exact science.

24
00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:28,400
Think about your readers first and not the search engines.

25
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:31,750
If your readers like your content they will come back for more.

26
00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:36,980
When you were writing your new posts always select some keywords to include and add these in a natural

27
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:41,660
way determine your most important keyword and add that to the title of the post.

28
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:44,510
Use the other keywords in the body of your posts.

29
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:49,340
Don't overdo it with keywords and use them too often as this can be seen as keyword stuffing by the

30
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:50,730
search engines.

31
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:56,450
Always check your new post for uniqueness use a service like copy scape that com to check this.

32
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:59,670
It is worth spending a few cents on this to ensure uniqueness.

33
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:04,340
If your post is not unique then it will be difficult to ranking in Google and the other search engines

34
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:09,680
outsource your content writing a lot of niche Web site owners don't want to write their own posts as

35
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:14,400
they feel that they are not good at writing or they just can't be bothered to spend the time to do this.

36
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,440
Having a good writer on board to write your posts is a good idea.

37
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:22,860
As you can spend your time on generating more traffic to your website where do you find a good writer.

38
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:28,010
Well there are many places you can find them such as gig based websites like 5 or dot com and people

39
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:34,490
per hour dot com and project Web sites such as Upward dot com freelancer dot com and guru dot com.

40
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:39,190
If you are choosing a writer for the first time then arrange a meeting via Instant Messenger with them.

41
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:43,520
Tell them what you are looking for and let them tell you about their experience and send you some samples

42
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,630
of their work.

43
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:48,350
There are other Web sites where you can get articles created very cheaply.

44
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:52,390
We're not going to name these Web sites here but the price charged will tell its own story.

45
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:57,740
A five dollar article is likely to be written by a person whose first language is not English.

46
00:02:57,740 --> 00:03:02,630
Sometimes you can get lucky but most of the time you will have to contend with grammar errors and more.

47
00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:06,770
There are reliable professional writers on websites like the Warrior Forum.

48
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:11,840
You can check their reviews before you decide one thing to note is that good writers are usually busy

49
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:15,210
and you may have to wait a few days for your content to be created.

50
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:20,180
Usually it is well worth the wait let your writer know the subject of your content and any keywords

51
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:21,420
you want included.

52
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:24,580
Also tell them what call the action you want at the end of the content.

53
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:28,170
Do you want readers to join your email list or check out a product page.

54
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:34,200
Once you find a good writer treat them well as they are pretty rare use PR content.

00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:36,970
