1
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:12,440
Generating ideas for niche markets.

2
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:17,030
In this video we will be looking at a number of ways that you can generate a list of possible niche

3
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:18,880
markets that you could pursue.

4
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:23,600
We want to make it very clear that you will not be deciding on your niche at this stage.

5
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:28,240
A lot of newcomers to niche marketing get very excited about the prospect and skip this stage.

6
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:33,590
While we understand the excitement it is not a good idea to go into a niece that you cannot be passionate

7
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:36,590
about or has very little opportunity to make money.

8
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:38,470
Identify your passions.

9
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:42,260
There is a lot of information out there about choosing a niche market and most of them will tell you

10
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:43,940
to follow your passions.

11
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:49,100
If you are really passionate about something then this makes a lot of sense as you will be very motivated

12
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:50,230
to make it work.

13
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:51,890
But it doesn't always work.

14
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:56,930
If you have a passion for a niche but the size of that niche is really small and the people in it rarely

15
00:00:56,930 --> 00:00:59,640
buy anything then you are just wasting your time.

16
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:04,800
Finding a niche that you can get passionate about is another story and we will discuss this later on.

17
00:01:04,849 --> 00:01:08,790
We agree that it makes a lot of sense to enter a niche market that you are passionate about.

18
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:14,630
Remember at this stage you are just compiling a list of possible niche ideas in the next video.

19
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:20,660
We will look at how you can test each idea for viability so we recommend that you identify the subjects

20
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:22,970
that really interest you first.

21
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,940
What are you really passionate and knowledgeable about.

22
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:30,350
Get yourself a pen and paper and start to write down the things that you are interested in.

23
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:32,750
Do not make any judgments at this stage.

24
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:37,040
If you find yourself struggling here then ask yourself these questions.

25
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:38,990
What hobbies do I have.

26
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:41,550
What sports are my interested in if any.

27
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:43,640
How do I spend my free time.

28
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:46,930
What do I like to read about online and off line.

29
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:49,160
What TV programs really interest me.

30
00:01:49,730 --> 00:01:52,300
What magazine subscriptions do I have.

31
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:56,940
What I really miss in my life if I couldn't participate in it or read about it.

32
00:01:57,110 --> 00:01:59,410
What problems do I have at the moment.

33
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:02,500
What things do I look for when I search online.

34
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:06,820
Well what I like to learn more about what skills do I want to develop.

35
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:09,509
What could I improve in my life.

36
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:14,690
This is just a small sample of the questions that you can ask yourself what you are doing here is looking

37
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,310
introspective Lee to see what really interests you.

38
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:22,400
It is likely that a few things will be significantly more interesting than others such as hobbies sports

39
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,660
TV etc..

40
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:30,410
Again do not make any prejudgment after spending just a few minutes doing this you should be able to

41
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:32,120
create a fairly long list.

42
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:36,470
If you are still struggling to come up with a lot of ideas at this point then don't worry because there

43
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:38,340
are other steps you need to take.

44
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:43,410
Put your marketing hat on now it's time to look at the world from a marketing perspective.

45
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:46,780
When you do this you will be able to come up with even more ideas.

46
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:50,180
Even if you have no interest in them at the moment don't worry about this.

47
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:51,640
Just write the ideas down.

48
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,610
You're going to play detective here.

49
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:58,310
You need a pen and notebook or a mobile device where you can jot down or record ideas.

50
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:02,840
It is best to start doing this at the beginning of a new day as you progress through your day.

51
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,330
Make a note of the following.

52
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:09,200
Any problems that you encounter things around you that attract your attention.

53
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,770
The kinds of conversations you have with other people.

54
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:14,360
What was on TV that appealed to you.

55
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:18,680
The products and services you use things that make you happy.

56
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:21,130
Things that make you angry or sad.

57
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:26,420
Activities you participate in determine the time to stop recording these things.

58
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:31,070
Then take a look at each one you have made a record of and ask the following questions.

59
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:33,930
Are other people interested in the same things.

60
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:36,820
Are people spending money to do these things.

61
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:39,640

62
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:42,770

63
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:46,140
What things made you angry or sad or frustrated.

64
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:51,890
Identify those things on your marketing list where you get a positive answer when you ask the questions.

65
00:03:51,890 --> 00:03:55,430
Any of these can be good niche marketing ideas where you can make money.
