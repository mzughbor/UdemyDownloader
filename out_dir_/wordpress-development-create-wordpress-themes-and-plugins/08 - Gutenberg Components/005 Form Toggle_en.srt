1
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:13,640
We're going to continue working with the night mode block currently the only way to turn on night mode

2
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:14,620
is through the toolbar.

3
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:18,830
That's perfectly fine, but you may want to provide this option in the sidebar.

4
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:23,240
Determining where an option is placed is a user experience design decision.

5
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:26,090
Therefore, that's beyond the scope of the course.

6
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:27,860
It's a case by case thing.

7
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:30,670
And so I'll leave it up to you where you think it should be placed.

8
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:35,170
For now, let's just say that we wanted this option to be present in the sidebar.

9
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:41,810
It's completely possible and allowed to have the same option available in multiple locations to get

10
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:42,350
started.

11
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:44,420
We're going to need to tell WordPress.

12
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:48,050
We'd like to add in some content to the sidebar when the block is selected.

13
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:52,270
We already know how to do this with the inspector controls component.

14
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:59,630
Let's load that in, open the index JS file for the night mode, blank at the top, the structure the

15
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:03,650
inspector controls component from the WP editor object.

16
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:12,820
We're also going to need some generic components from the WP components Object D structure, the panel

17
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:16,000
body panel RO and form TORGAU components.

18
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:21,560
I'm introducing a new component here called Form Toggle.

19
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:25,850
This is a custom form that will allow the user to toggle the value.

20
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:27,290
You'll see how it works.

21
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:30,920
Soon enough, the next step would be to create the attribute.

22
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:34,760
However, it doesn't make sense to have two values for night mode.

23
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:37,570
We'll just use the same attribute for the button.

24
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:44,270
Let's just head on over to the edit function since will be using the inspector controls component then

25
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:46,790
will need to return array instead of the block.

26
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:55,630
Right above the block, I'm going to use the inspector controls panel body and panel road components.

27
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:08,770
A lot of this should be familiar to you, I'm sitting the title to night mode and making it translatable.

28
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:13,600
We're going to use the panel RO component as the form toggle component.

29
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:19,900
We're about to use requires the formatting provided by this component inside the panel RO component

30
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:21,730
and the form toggle component.

31
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:26,570
First, let's assign the ID attribute.

32
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:32,390
I'm going to set this to you to meet Nash recipe Dash nine, dash moad dash toggle.

33
00:02:34,570 --> 00:02:40,010
Then we'll need to set the check to attribute this needs to be either true or false.

34
00:02:40,210 --> 00:02:42,690
We'll set this to the night mode, actually.

35
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:51,250
Next, we'll need to set the on change attribute, what will happen if the user clicks on this field?

36
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:54,070
We want to update the night mode attribute.

37
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:58,190
This will be the exact same code we use for the button in the toolbar.

38
00:02:58,490 --> 00:02:59,570
Here's the problem, though.

39
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,890
We're rewriting the logic in two different places.

40
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:09,800
It would be better to make this into a reusable function above the return statement, create a constant

41
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,240
named Toggle Nite mode.

42
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,110
Cut and paste the function from the unclick event.

43
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:29,630
Now that we have a reusable function, let's set the on change and on events to the toggle night mode

44
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:30,110
function.

45
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:37,660
Before we declare this complete, the form torgau component will not generate a label, so we'll need

46
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:41,620
to do that ourselves right above the component and the label tag.

47
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:48,500
The text inside should be set to night mode that will also be translate ready.

48
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:58,200
I'm also going to set the four attribute, however, for is a reserved keyword in JavaScript, so we'll

49
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:01,300
need to use the HTML four attribute instead.

50
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:03,720
This is one of those react quirks.

51
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:07,110
The value for this should be the idea of the input field.

52
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:10,530
In this case, it would be Udemy dash recipe.

53
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:12,780
Dash nine dash mode dash toggle.

54
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:22,280
We're finished, save your changes and CD into the bloc's directory, run the NPM run dev command.

55
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:26,650
You shouldn't receive any errors so far.

56
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:32,760
Go ahead and try creating a new recipe post, you should be able to add the night mode block without

57
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:35,010
a problem with the block selected.

58
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:39,660
You should see the button appear in the toolbar and the form toggle field in the sidebar.

59
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:41,410
This is fantastic.

60
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:45,480
If you were to click on the toggle, then you'll see that night mode is enabled.

61
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:47,610
The button will also be turned on.

62
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:50,190
You can click in anywhere you want.

63
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,810
Everything should stay in sync.

64
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,920
WordPress will be able to manage everything for you.

65
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:58,250
All you have to do is take the time to tie everything up.

66
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:02,800
Once again, it's up to you to decide where these options should be placed.

67
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,580
My advice would be to not clutter the toolbar.

68
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:08,610
You want everything to be intuitive as possible.

69
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:09,690
All right.

70
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:10,710
That does it for now.

71
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:16,050
In the next couple of lectures, I'll introduce you to some of the other components for creating input

72
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:16,650
fields.

73
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:18,850
Oh.
