Thanks!</p><h4>LectureNotes</h4><p><strong>High Level Overview of Gutenberg</strong></p><ul><li><p>Gutenberg Splits itself up into multiple packages. You can find those packages in the <strong>packages</strong> directory in the GitHub repository.</p></li><li><p>WordPress is planning on making the whole admin dashboard a single page app. Its placed generic components in the <strong>components</strong> package.</p></li><li><p>The <strong>data</strong> package is where Gutenberg manages the state. The <strong>state</strong> is a term used to describe the data in your application.</p></li><li><p>Gutenberg wraps the React functions for creating elements on the DOM. This is so that it can provide backwards compatibility if React was to ever change.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Gutenberg Blocks with ES5</strong></p><ul><li><p>The <strong>Gutenberg Examples</strong> repository is the official repo for how to build blocks for Gutenberg.</p></li><li><p>You will find examples for building blocks with ES5 and ESNext. Its not necessary to use Webpack, Babel or SASS.</p></li><li><p>Its recommended that you use self-invoked functions to contain your blocks code. Its also useful for shortening the names of functions and properties.</p></li><li><p>The <strong>wp.element.createElement</strong> function will create an element. Its what JSX gets converted into.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Rich Text Block</strong></p><ul><li><p>Rich Text are components that allow the user to edit text with formatting.</p></li><li><p>The <strong>RichText</strong> component can be found in the <strong>wp.editor</strong> object.</p></li><li><p>Setting the <strong>source</strong> to <strong>children</strong> will instruct Gutenberg to extract the content from the children elements selected with the <strong>selector</strong> property.</p></li><li><p>The <strong>tagName</strong> property will be the element that gets wrapped around your content. The <strong>multiline</strong> property will be the element that breaks up your content. By default its a break tag.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Custom Toolbar</strong></p><ul><li><p>The <strong>toolbar</strong> component will correctly position and separate your custom buttons from the other buttons in the toolbar.</p></li><li><p>The <strong>tooltip</strong> component will display a tooltip whenever the user hovers over the content placed inside of the component. This is optional to add, but helpful.</p></li><li><p>The <strong>button</strong> component will create a button that is stylized for the Gutenberg editor.<br>The <strong>classnames</strong> function will allow you to merge multiple classes together. Its helpful for when you need to dynamically add classes. Something that cant be easily done in react.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Form Toggle</strong></p><ul><li><p>You are allowed to have multiple input fields/buttons that control the same setting. Gutenberg will be able to sync everything together for you.</p></li><li><p>The <strong>FormToggle</strong> component will create a toggle form field that toggles a single value. Similar to a checkbox.</p></li><li><p>JSX does not support for the <strong>for</strong> attribute. Instead you need to use the <strong>htmlFor</strong> attribute.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Inspector Control Fields</strong></p><ul><li><p>The <strong>TextareaControl</strong> component will render a textarea input form field.</p></li><li><p>The <strong>CheckboxControl</strong> component will render a checkbox input form field. The <strong>checked</strong> property must be either <strong>true</strong> or <strong>false</strong>.</p></li><li><p>The <strong>RadioControl</strong> component will render a radio control input form field. The <strong>options</strong> property must be an array of all the options in object form.</p></li><li><p>The <strong>RangeControl</strong> component will render a slider that the user can drag back and forth to change a value. A value can also be set manually. Youre allowed to pass in your own custom icons. Its recommended you store the icons in a separate file to keep things clean and organized.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Media Uploads</strong></p><ul><li><p>The <strong>MediaUploadCheck</strong> component will check if the user is logged in. If they are, then the <strong>MediaUpload</strong> component will render.</p></li><li><p>The <strong>render</strong> property will run a function that you can use to display a UI to the user. Perfect for displaying a button to open the media library.</p></li><li><p>The <strong>onSelect</strong> event will run when an media item is uploaded. Youll be passed in an object holding information about the item selected.</p></li><li><p>The <strong>allowedTypes</strong> property is an array of file types that the user can select.</p></li></ul>
