Our site is starting to come along really well.
1

2
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:15,720
All we need to do is make it more dynamic and fix a lot of the links before we can do this.
2

3
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:22,600
We need to have some dummy content setup so let's add some dummy content navigate to the dashboard and
3

4
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:28,810
let's add a new plugin in search for the plugin called faker press this plug will take care of generating
4

5
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:36,210
dummy content for your site install and activate it.
5

6
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:36,600
All right.
6

7
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:41,760
So once activated you'll see a new menu item pop up called faker press.
7

8
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,760
Let's start by creating some users first.
8

9
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:50,740
I'm going to create just two users and I'm going to set their roles to offer click generate.
9

10
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:53,590
And you should see a success message afterwards.
10

11
00:00:53,610 --> 00:01:00,330
If the two users were created next I want to create some terms.
11

12
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:06,960
Even though we haven't discussed what terms are all you need to know is that they are words and phrases
12

13
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,430
attached to a post.
13

14
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:15,660
I'm going to set the quantity between five and 10 the name size will be between 1 and 3.
14

15
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:22,580
The taxonomy is will be set to categories and tags that should do it.
15

16
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:25,920
Click generate and that should generate some terms.
16

17
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:30,760
Lastly let's create some posts under press posts.
17

18
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:36,990
This will allow us to generate some posts and the quantity put 15 and 20.
18

19
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:40,220
Change the date to last 15 days.
19

20
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:45,870
Set the author feel to all users including the admin.
20

21
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:48,440
A lot of these fields are fine as is.
21

22
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:53,650
Scroll down to the taxonomy section and select all the terms we created previously
22

23
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:02,620
set the rate to 100.
23

24
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:05,950
Leave the rest of the fields as is and click generate.
24

25
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:10,060
This may take a while for some of you as images are being downloaded for preview.
25

26
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:20,730
Hopefully you will receive a success message once that's finished.
26

27
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:22,920
Let's view the posts generated.
27

28
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:28,740
We don't need to generate any more content from faker press for now so I'm going to deactivate this
28

29
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:34,290
plugin let's create one page called about us.
29

30
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:43,170
Insert a few words and then publish it.
30

31
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:45,560
Lastly let's create a menu.
31

32
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:51,180
The menu links should be right under appearance but you'll notice that it's unavailable to us.
32

33
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:55,660
This is because we need to tell WordPress that our theme supports menus.
33

34
00:02:55,690 --> 00:02:58,180
Let's learn how to do that in the next lecture.
