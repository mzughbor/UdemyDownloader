1
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:13,630
Now it's time to format the search form, unlike the other widgets, WordPress makes it easy to apply

2
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:20,050
styles and formatting to the search for you may be wondering why the search form is a more unique widget

3
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:26,140
than the other default WordPress widgets, the default WordPress widgets just provide links to other

4
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:27,050
parts of your site.

5
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:32,770
However, search forms are more complex and vary from site to site when it comes to design.

6
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:36,550
Search forms can also appear in various parts of your site.

7
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:39,200
This makes it a reusable component.

8
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:46,210
With that said, WordPress recognizes that the search form should be stylized by the theme and not WordPress

9
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:46,770
itself.

10
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:53,230
If you don't have any styles or formats available, then WordPress automatically generates the HTML

11
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:54,250
for the search widget.

12
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:58,490
So how does WordPress know if we have a search form template?

13
00:00:59,110 --> 00:00:59,890
It's simple.

14
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:03,430
We just need to create a template called search form.

15
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:06,460
Let's create this file now.

16
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:16,010
Inside this template, out the following e-mail, you can find the text inside the slash assets, slash

17
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:23,880
extra slash search form, dot text file, it will contain all the HTML and code you'll need.

18
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:24,930
All right.

19
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:28,380
Let's go over what's in this HTML one by one.

20
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:33,010
The very first thing we do is generate a unique ID for the input fields.

21
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:35,880
This isn't required, but it's good practice.

22
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:43,710
The unique ID function helps us generate a unique ID we can pass in a string to prepend to the ID.

23
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:50,100
Then we use the escape attribute function which will make sure the string is safe for use.

24
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:56,210
Inside an attribute, WordPress provides a set of functions for making sure your data is safe for output.

25
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:59,470
One of these is called the escape attribute function.

26
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:04,260
This will make sure the value can be used inside an HTML attribute.

27
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:08,830
I'll talk more about the various sanitation functions in a future lecture.

28
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:11,039
For now, let's keep moving forward.

29
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:18,600
Even though creating an I.D. isn't required, I consider it an important step, templates are reusable.

30
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:21,940
The search form template is no exception to this.

31
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:26,260
This template can be used multiple times throughout any other template.

32
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:32,080
Since there is a possibility of having multiple search form templates, then we want to make sure the

33
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,710
input has a unique ID each time.

34
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:38,120
This makes it easier to differentiate between forms.

35
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:40,980
Let's look at the rest of this HTML.

36
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:43,660
First, we need a form tag.

37
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:48,220
We must set the class method and action attributes.

38
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:52,020
The class should be set to search Dasch form.

39
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:57,080
This allows for any plugins to add any JavaScript into this form if needed.

40
00:02:57,580 --> 00:03:00,550
You can also add additional classes if you want to.

41
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:06,510
The method should always be set to get as that's what's recommended by WordPress.

42
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:10,710
The action attribute should be the euro to the home page.

43
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:14,450
I'm introducing a new function here called Home You URL.

44
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:17,260
This is a function provided by WordPress.

45
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:20,950
We simply pass in a forward slash to instruct it.

46
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:23,190
We just want the route home URL.

47
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:30,790
We're also using the escape URL function to make sure that the euro return is safe and is just a euro.

48
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:36,040
Like the other functions, this function is defined and provided by WordPress.

49
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:39,790
You do not need to do anything to make sure it's available to you.

50
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:43,330
Next, we have to set up the input tag.

51
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:45,460
The name should always be.

52
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:50,050
S WordPress uses this name for something called the Loop.

53
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:54,250
The loop is something we'll go over in a future lecture for now.

54
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:59,530
Just now you should always set the name attribute to S next.

55
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:04,080
The field's value will be set to the value returned by the search query function.

56
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:08,110
This function simply outputs the search, query the user input it.

57
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:11,890
If there is no search query, it'll just output an empty string.

58
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:15,040
So you may be wondering where I'm getting all this info.

59
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:21,910
Well, there's a function called get search form which will look for a file named search form P P and

60
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:22,630
then output it.

61
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:27,040
Otherwise this function will generate some default HTML for you.

62
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:30,070
This function is used from within the search widget.

63
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:31,930
In the resource section.

64
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:34,450
I provide a link to learn more about this function.

65
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:38,470
You'll notice that we're in the developer site of WordPress.

66
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:44,410
Something I absolutely love about this site of WordPress is that if you were to search for a function

67
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:47,550
and scroll down, you'll find a section called Source.

68
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,940
This part of the page will actually show you the source code and WordPress.

69
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:53,980
Let's examine the source code.

70
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:57,550
A lot of this is mostly unimportant to us for the time being.

71
00:04:58,030 --> 00:05:01,930
Further down, you'll find a part of the code that generates HTML.

72
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:03,640
There are two versions.

73
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:08,440
One version is for HTML five and another is for HTML.

74
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:14,020
Currently our theme is meant for modern sites and so we're using the HTML5 version.

75
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:17,260
What I did was started with this form as a base.

76
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:21,190
Then I modified it a bit to match the design of my theme.

77
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:23,860
You are allowed to do the same if you wish.

78
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:30,880
There are only four important things we need to set and that is the method action, the inputs name

79
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,260
and the current search value.

80
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:37,990
You do not need to have every class or HTML as the one WordPress generates.

81
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:42,220
The point of making your own template is to customize it to your needs.

82
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:47,680
Besides the four things I pointed out earlier, everything else is completely up to you.

83
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:49,030
That's it.

84
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:53,320
Let's refresh the page and see if the form is formatted correctly.

85
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:57,070
This looks so much better because it fits with the rest of the theme.

86
00:05:57,580 --> 00:06:03,610
We haven't created a search template yet, so we can't actually see the results generated by the search.

87
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,890
We'll be doing that in a future lecture.

88
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:12,460
One last thing I want to note is that inside the form we're using a function called Underscore E, which

89
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:14,620
is similar to the double underscore function.

90
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:21,220
The difference between these two functions is that the underscore E function will echo out the translated

91
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:22,990
shrink rather than returning it.

92
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:26,910
That covers how to create a search form template.

93
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:30,970
Keep in mind that creating this template is completely optional.

94
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:34,420
You can just let WordPress handle it and that would be just fine.

95
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:35,560
All right.

96
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:37,210
I'll see you in the next lecture.
