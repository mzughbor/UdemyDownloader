00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:13,450
Pagination is pretty simple in the resource section, I provide a link to word pressies, pagination,

2
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:19,960
codecs page typically pagination tends to be difficult because you have to account for various scenarios.

3
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:25,570
However, as you can see here, WordPress provides a few functions that we can use for pagination.

4
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:30,820
These functions will work universally on various templates and different types of pages.

5
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:34,960
This is great because now you don't have to do a lot of the work.

6
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:37,680
WordPress will do the heavy lifting for you.

7
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:42,160
All you have to do is call these functions in the appropriate locations.

8
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:45,490
Opened the index template inside your editor.

9
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:50,710
At the bottom of the template, you'll see the static pagination buttons right above the links.

10
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:52,480
I'm going to place my code here.

11
00:00:52,810 --> 00:00:55,270
Call the function next post link.

12
00:00:57,550 --> 00:01:03,220
This function is pretty simple, it will check if there are older posts and if there is, then it'll

13
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:04,739
output a link to that page.

14
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:08,020
There's an optional parameter, which is the text to display.

15
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:12,130
I'm going to use the text I had in the static pagination link.

16
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:20,680
Next, we're going to use a function called Previous Posts Link.

17
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:27,280
Which does the same thing as our previous function, except it checks for newer posts.

18
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:33,810
I will also pass in the same text in its static version, I'm going to comment out the static version

19
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:37,980
of the pagination links will be needing them later, so no need to get rid of them.

20
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:42,540
All right, let's refresh the page and test out the pagination links.

21
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:44,870
The links should be appearing and working.

22
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:46,590
However, there is a problem.

23
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:48,870
They don't have the nice styling.

24
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:52,750
Unfortunately, these can't be changed through the function.

25
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:57,330
Instead, we have to use something called filters to accomplish this.

26
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:59,070
We haven't gotten that far.

27
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:02,970
So for now, we're going to leave things as is in a future.

28
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:08,729
Lecture will be fixing these pagination links to look more like the static template after we've discussed

29
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:12,100
filters now that everything is working perfectly.

30
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:13,740
Let's take a look at our template.

31
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,980
When we started, we had a few hundred lines of code.

32
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:22,250
With the help of WordPress, it's been reduced heavily to less than one hundred lines of code.

33
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:24,750
We worried very little about the code.

34
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:31,290
It's extremely easy to integrate your template into a WordPress that we haven't had to write one single

35
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:33,560
database query or perform any checks.

36
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:35,910
This is the power of WordPress.

37
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:37,330
It is this simple.

38
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,570
This concludes this section.

39
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:45,000
We started out with a static HTML template and converted it into a functioning WordPress theme.

40
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:50,550
This theme is not even close to complete, but look at how far we got in such a short amount of time.

41
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:56,830
I'm going to recap over some of the things we've learned so far.

42
00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:01,470
One of the most important steps we took was loading the stylesheets and scripts.

43
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:04,430
We did this by registering and interviewing them.

44
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:09,670
A lot of beginners usually want to avoid the step and just manually link them in the head.

45
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:13,290
However, this is considered bad practice.

46
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:17,320
You end up missing out on a lot of the features WordPress provides.

47
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:22,630
There are plug ins out there that provide compression, magnification and concatenation.

48
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:26,380
All these concepts speed up your site significantly.

49
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:31,340
These features are only available if you register and in queue your files.

50
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:37,480
So it's always important that you use the proper hooks and functions for loading your files, never

51
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:40,050
manually placed them in the head tags.

52
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,590
The next thing we did was start displaying the menus.

53
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:45,850
There are two ways to go about this.

54
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:48,800
You can manually create your own menu system.

55
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:53,230
This is a completely acceptable solution, but it is not a common one.

56
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:56,710
WordPress provides this feature along with others.

57
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:57,190
For you.

58
00:03:57,850 --> 00:04:01,750
All you have to do is register a menu and then display it in your template.

59
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:05,660
WordPress takes care of managing and processing the data for you.

60
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:10,220
After that, we began splitting up the template into various sections.

61
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:13,570
This makes our code more readable and easier to manage.

62
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:18,370
We also took care of creating the form and began displaying the posts.

63
00:04:19,029 --> 00:04:20,800
The steps we took were pretty simple.

64
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:26,380
I want to stress that even though all this was simple, you shouldn't take this process lightly.

65
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:31,660
Most developers will try and stuff all their coding in as little files as possible.

66
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:35,700
While this does speed things up, it can make things harder to scale.

67
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:40,560
You should be very conscious about how you organize your files and what you put in them.

68
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:47,320
You'll repeatedly see me try and separate our code throughout this course and the next section we're

69
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,480
going to start working on other templates.

70
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:53,890
Templates give you the opportunity to display content in various styles.

71
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:56,980
You'll see what that looks like in the next few lectures.
