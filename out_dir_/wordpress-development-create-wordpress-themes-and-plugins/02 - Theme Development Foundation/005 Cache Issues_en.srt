00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:13,960
One of the most common annoyances Web developers face is caching, caching is a pretty basic concept.

2
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:17,060
Whenever you visit a site, you're downloading files.

3
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:19,920
These range from iest to image files.

4
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:26,710
The Web would be quite slow if you had to download those same files over and over again to solve this.

5
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:31,780
Your browser will store copies of those files and then load those copies rather than downloading the

6
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:32,420
same files.

7
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:35,230
Again, this provides a better user experience.

8
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:41,280
Overall, as developers, we want this, but not during the development phase of a plug in or theme.

9
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:48,100
If I made a change to a file, then I won't be able to see those changes as the browser will load the

10
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:50,560
cached version rather than the updated version.

11
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:59,070
Right now, I have my browser opened up for the home page, I'm going to press F 12 on my keyboard to

12
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:00,620
open up the developer tools.

13
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,870
One of the most helpful tabs is the network out.

14
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:05,010
Select that tab.

15
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:11,160
Now, this tab will display a list of files that have been downloaded and how long it took to download

16
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:11,380
them.

17
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:14,940
It also keep track of the order downloaded and size.

18
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,150
So you may be thinking, how does this relate to caching?

19
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:23,820
Well, this town provides some really helpful information to determine whether a file was cached or

20
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:24,090
not.

21
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:27,580
Before we view what's cached, let's filter the results.

22
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:31,980
Right now, the network tab will display every single file downloaded.

23
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:37,870
I'm going to filter this to only display CFS file so that this doesn't get cluttered.

24
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:39,620
I want you to do the same.

25
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:43,620
Once you have the CSF filter on, refresh the page.

26
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:47,970
The page shouldn't load normally, but let's focus on the network tab.

27
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:53,970
Taking a closer look at the science column, you'll see that the browser only loads cached versions

28
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:54,720
of the files.

29
00:01:55,140 --> 00:02:00,510
It doesn't matter how many times you refresh the page, it'll always load these files from the cache.

30
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:04,130
Any changes we make will not be reflected on the page.

31
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:06,560
There are a couple of ways to get around this.

32
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:11,130
The first immediate option is to check this box that says disable cache.

33
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:13,800
I don't recommend you check this box.

34
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:19,190
While this does allow the latest version to load, this option will affect all sites we visit.

35
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:22,290
This includes Facebook, YouTube, etc..

36
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:28,230
If I hover my mouse over this option, then you'll also see that the developer tools have to be opened

37
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:28,440
up.

38
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:32,390
In order for this option to work, I'm going to uncheck this box.

39
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:36,770
The second solution would be to press control F5 on our keyboards.

40
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:41,880
This will force the browser to clear the cache for the current site and refresh the page.

41
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:46,430
After a while you'll see that the true size of each file is displayed.

42
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:51,240
This indicates that the file was downloaded from the server and not the browsers cache.

43
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:53,790
This works, but it isn't ideal.

44
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:59,260
I hate having to refresh the page twice because I forgot to clear the cache on the first refresh.

45
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:04,060
The ideal solution would be to trick the browser into downloading the file.

46
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:05,610
Let me show you what I mean.

47
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:11,550
If you look at the file names, you'll notice that WordPress adds a query parameter called BRX, which

48
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:12,660
is short for a version.

49
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:16,500
The value for this will be the actual version of WordPress.

50
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:19,680
This simple trick forces the browser to download.

51
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,350
The latest version of the file of WordPress is updated.

52
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:23,830
It works rather well.

53
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:28,930
However, if I refresh the page again, then you'll see that the version never changes.

54
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:33,120
This works perfectly for upgrades, but not so much for development.

55
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:36,630
Luckily, we can modify this behavior easily.

56
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:41,600
Let's open our editors and review the NQ file we worked on in the previous election.

57
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,490
We're going to start with the stylesheets first.

58
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:50,070
The WP register style function we're using here has a fourth parameter called version.

59
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:57,420
Right now we're only taking advantage of the first to the third parameter would be an array of dependencies,

60
00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:00,150
but none of our files required that kind of power.

61
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:02,430
So I'm going to pass in an empty array.

62
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:06,570
The fourth parameter allows us to pass in a custom version.

63
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:12,660
No, if we don't want to use the WordPress version number by default, this will be set to false, which

64
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:18,839
will let WordPress pick the version instead of hard coding, a version I'm going to pass in the time

65
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:19,350
function.

66
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:23,100
Now I'll refresh the page and view the network tab.

67
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:28,220
I applied this to the Google font so we should see the file size appearing for that file.

68
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:31,860
As expected, the file is now loading from the server.

69
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:38,460
If I were to hover my mouse over the filename, you'll see that the full URL includes the version query

70
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:39,000
parameter.

71
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:42,930
The value for this will be the value of the time function.

72
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:46,050
This is great, but it can definitely be improved.

73
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:47,910
Let's switch back to the editor.

74
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:51,540
The next logical step would be to update each function.

75
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,310
But there's a problem with that.

76
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:55,710
Let's say we were finished with our theme.

77
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:59,400
We would have to come back to this file and update the values again.

78
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:05,820
Then if we wanted to make changes, we would have to update the values once more before moving forward.

79
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:09,570
That can be a bit annoying, but this can be solved easily.

80
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:13,620
I'm going to open the functions file inside this file.

81
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:15,270
We have a section called Set Up.

82
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:21,090
Personally, I like to create a constant that determines whether we're in development mode or not.

83
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:25,950
You don't have to do this, but I recommend you do as it'll make your life easier.

84
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:32,040
I'm going to create a constant named Jiyu dev mode with the value of true.

85
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:42,260
Then let's go back to the interview file and create a variable named version right below the URAI variable,

86
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:47,180
the value for this will be Jiyu dev mode time false.

87
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:56,570
Basically, I'm checking if development mode is on, if it is all set, the aversion to the value returned

88
00:05:56,570 --> 00:06:03,500
by the time function, if development is off, then offset the value to false below in the register

89
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:03,990
function.

90
00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:08,300
I'm going to replace the time function with the version variable like so.

91
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:13,980
Now, I'm going to do the same for the rest of the register functions.

92
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:28,310
For the script functions, I'm going to update these from false to the version variable.

93
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:31,230
That's it.

94
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:36,830
Now, we don't have to update all of this in the future, switching between development and production

95
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:37,080
mode.

96
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:39,250
It's as simple as modifying one value.

97
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:45,190
Let's refresh the page and see the changes the page should load normally without any errors.

98
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:51,110
If we were to view the network tab, then you'll see the version for our files are completely dependent

99
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:52,090
on the current time.

100
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:54,710
We no longer have to worry about caching.
