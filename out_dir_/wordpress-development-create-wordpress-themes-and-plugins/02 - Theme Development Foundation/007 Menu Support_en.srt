1
00:00:07,939 --> 00:00:13,970
Right now, I'm on the documentation page for the Register NAV menu function, the first step to getting

2
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:19,820
menus to work is to register that just like styles and scripts, WordPress requires you to register

3
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:23,480
your menus before you can display that this function will help you with that.

4
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:30,080
As you can see, there's only two required parameters, which is the location and a short description.

5
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:33,140
The location can be thought of as a special ID.

6
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:39,590
If we scroll down further, you'll find that WordPress provides an example and this example, WordPress

7
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:42,440
uses an action hook called after set up theme.

8
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:47,350
This is the hook WordPress recommends for this function as instructed.

9
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:50,630
Let's open the functions file just like last time.

10
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:54,530
We're going to organize our code under the hooks section.

11
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:56,960
I'm going to call the add action function.

12
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:02,840
According to the documentation, the most appropriate hook we should use is called after set up theme.

13
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:11,170
This hook is called When our theme is loaded internally, I don't mean that the page itself is loaded,

14
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:15,540
but all the functions you defined inside the functions file is loaded.

15
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:21,180
The function that will be called is Jiyu set up within this function isn't defined.

16
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:22,570
So we'll have to do that now.

17
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:26,730
Create a file inside the includes folder called Set Up.

18
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,620
And then I want you to define the function.

19
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:33,220
Lastly, including.

20
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:43,670
The reason we aren't creating this file inside the front folder is because some of the functions will

21
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:47,650
be using here will be applied to both the front end and the back end.

22
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:51,730
Now that the function is ready, let's call the register now.

23
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:52,490
Menu function.

24
00:01:54,820 --> 00:02:01,000
We need to provide this function a location and description, I'm going to call this menu primary and

25
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,730
give it a simple description of primary menu.

26
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:11,820
Before I continue, I'm going to wrap my description inside a function that doesn't really have a proper

27
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:18,810
name, but it's called By Typing to underscores this function is a special function created by WordPress.

28
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:22,670
It allows for text to be translated into various languages.

29
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:27,000
We haven't gone over translations yet, but I'll give you a quick rundown.

30
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:33,480
WordPress comes with various functions for translating strings, but double underscore function is just

31
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:35,460
one of the most commonly used ones.

32
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:40,290
When we start talking about translations, I'll show you the various functions available.

33
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:43,290
For now, let's focus on this one function.

34
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:45,600
This function has two parameters.

35
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:48,990
The first parameter is the string you would like to translate.

36
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,110
The second parameter is the text domain.

37
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:58,530
This translation is using earlier we talked about text domains when we created the file header.

38
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:02,430
The text domain is basically the name of your theme folder.

39
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:04,920
In our case, this would be you to me.

40
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:08,190
So what does the text domain actually do?

41
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:13,140
Well, first of all, your theme won't be the only file that has translations.

42
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:19,710
Users might have various plugins activating those plugins will most likely have their own translations.

43
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:23,250
You can think of a text domain as an ID.

44
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:29,460
If we pass in our text domain, WordPress will know you want to use a translation from our theme and

45
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:32,300
not some other plugin loaded anyway.

46
00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:37,440
We actually have and created a translation file and we won't be doing so right now.

47
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:43,650
If WordPress doesn't find a translation and WordPress just won't translate the string and return the

48
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:49,200
original string, you don't have to translate every string, but I highly recommend it.

49
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,380
So you're plug in or theme can be used by the whitens audience?

50
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:52,950
Possible.

51
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:53,850
All right.

52
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:54,930
That's it for now.

53
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:57,180
If you didn't understand, that's fine.

54
00:03:57,450 --> 00:04:00,090
I'll be going more in-depth in a future lecture.

55
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:06,810
Now that we've registered our menu, let's display it in the resources section of this lecture.

56
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:10,560
I have included a link to a function called WP NAV menu.

57
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:11,970
Let's take a look at it.

58
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:16,649
As you can see, WordPress has thoroughly documented this function.

59
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,870
It's very powerful and flexible.

60
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:24,750
We won't be going over every bit here since we don't need to use all the options available to us for

61
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:25,290
our theme.

62
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:32,130
Basically, what this function does is generate a menu for us and outputs it onto wherever we call it.

63
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:34,320
Let's get started with using it.

64
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,390
Open the index template.

65
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:42,600
I want you to search for the navigation tag with the IDE primary menu right above.

66
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,270
It should be a comment that says primary navigation.

67
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:50,880
Inside this element, you'll find an unordered list with a comment above it that says Main menu.

68
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:53,790
I want you to delete this menu like so.

69
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:04,550
Next, open some tags and create a conditional statement.

70
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:12,820
We're going to check if the current theme has a particular menu, you can do this by calling the has

71
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:13,960
now menu function.

72
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:22,640
We can then pass in the name of location, which is primary, if this menu exists, then we can continue

73
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:25,150
on inside this conditional statement.

74
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:28,190
We're going to call the WP now menu function.

75
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:36,120
This function can be called as is, and WordPress will just use its default settings, but we don't

76
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:36,570
want that.

77
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:39,100
We have some things we would like to specify.

78
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:42,580
This function only has one parameter, which is an array.

79
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,790
So let's create an array.

80
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:48,180
And in this array, the first item will be theme location.

81
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:56,660
This key's value should be the location name we use in the register nav menu function, the name of

82
00:05:56,660 --> 00:06:01,520
the menu we registered was called Primary, so this key's value should be primary.

83
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:03,980
Next, let's define the container.

84
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:12,990
The container is simply a tag that is wrapped around the Navigations HTML WordPress will generate the

85
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:14,570
HTML for our menu.

86
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:21,560
The HTML generated is simply ULE and elai tags or simply known as an unordered list.

87
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:28,320
The container key simply asks if we want to wrap this unordered list with a div or nav tag.

88
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:31,090
Depending on your needs, you can use either.

89
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:36,870
However, our theme is using bootstrap and we already have our navigation wrapped with a div tech,

90
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:38,730
so we don't want either.

91
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,230
Let's pass in false.

92
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:49,420
Therefore, WordPress won't wrap our unordered list with a div or Navteq, there's another key we can

93
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:51,640
set, which is the menu Klasky.

94
00:06:53,950 --> 00:07:00,580
This key allows you to access classes to the ultimate I'm assuming you may want to do this if you're

95
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:05,710
using your own template to add multiple classes, you just spaced the class names like.

96
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:07,900
So class one, class two.

97
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:12,140
For this thing, we don't need to use this key, so I'm going to get rid of it.

98
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:13,580
We're almost done.

99
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:17,050
The next key I want to set is the fallback CBG.

100
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:22,850
In some cases, your users will not have any menu setup.

101
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:26,650
This is usually true on a fresh installation of WordPress.

102
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:30,810
This key allows you to call a function to display a default menu.

103
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:36,310
You can set this to false if you don't want to display a default menu or HTML.

104
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,460
Lastly, we can define the depth.

105
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:49,400
The depth is how many submenus the user can have currently my success only allows for a depth of four.

106
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:53,700
If you want to have more depth, you can do so by adding additional access.

107
00:07:54,030 --> 00:07:59,180
If you want to allow an unlimited number of submenu items, then you can set this to zero.

108
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:00,610
That's it.

109
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:04,510
Now, if we refresh the page, it won't work as expected.

110
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:07,420
This is because we haven't created a menu yet.

111
00:08:07,890 --> 00:08:14,250
Let's do that now inside the WordPress dashboard, go to appearance menus and then create a menu.

112
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:29,070
Take quick notice of the menu settings section, you'll see that there's a some section called Display

113
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:29,740
Location.

114
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:34,419
This lists all the display locations we registered in our set up file.

115
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:37,309
Let's assign this menu to the primary menu.

116
00:08:37,710 --> 00:08:44,130
I'm only going to have the about page assigned to this menu after saving the menu, go back to the front

117
00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:45,240
end and refresh.

118
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:49,620
You'll notice the about menu item being generated properly.

119
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:53,910
You can click this if you like, and it will work, but it won't display.

120
00:08:53,910 --> 00:09:00,490
The content will fix that very soon if you haven't already removed the static HTML for the menu.

121
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:02,890
Let's recap what's going on.

122
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:09,410
First, we tell WordPress that our theme has a location for menus by using the register, now menu function.

123
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:16,500
Lastly, we tell WordPress where to load the menu in our template by using the WP now menu function.

124
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:21,630
Something I want you to note is that you don't have to call these functions from within the hook.

125
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:25,650
These functions can be called directly inside the functions file.

126
00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:29,980
However, I highly advise that you use hooks whenever possible.

127
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:34,920
This is so only code that should be called is called in appropriate locations.

128
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:40,710
If you were to stuff your functions, file with loads of code, then you make it hard to debug it since

129
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:41,910
so much is going on.

130
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:47,970
Another thing I want to note is that in the WordPress menu page, you'll see WordPress outputted the

131
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:50,940
phrase primary menu for the display location.

132
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:55,320
Earlier I told you about translations and how they're performed.

133
00:09:55,710 --> 00:10:00,450
WordPress acknowledged that this phrase can be translated and tried to translate it.

134
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:03,390
Since we don't have any translation set.

135
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:06,150
WordPress then outputted the string as is.

136
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:12,360
I just wanted you to notice that before I in this lecture, I want you to be aware of how the markup

137
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,270
and accesses for my menu.

138
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:16,790
This is not a bootstrap menu.

139
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:19,500
This is a custom made access menu.

140
00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:24,540
Despite Bootstrap coming with its own classes for menus, I decided not to use it.

141
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:28,980
Now, this is just a success preference and not related to WordPress.

142
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:34,520
But that being said, bootstrap requires that you set up a menu with certain classes.

143
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:41,310
Unfortunately, the WP nav menu function is pretty limited when it comes to adding classes to certain

144
00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:41,880
menus.

145
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:45,690
And these cases you have to use something called a walker.

146
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:50,100
Walker's are a programming concept and not specific to WordPress.

147
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:56,760
Only walkers are a way to go through an array and if those arrays have arrays inside of them, it'll

148
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:57,630
go through that too.

149
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:02,190
It just keeps going and going until every value has been looped through.

150
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:05,160
Creating a walker can be fairly complex.

151
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:11,100
Luckily, there's a developer who has solved the problem of creating a walker with bootstrap markup

152
00:11:11,730 --> 00:11:13,290
in the resources section.

153
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:17,940
On this lecture, I provide a link to the WP Bootstrap NAV Walker class.

154
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:22,600
I won't be going through this as it's not necessary for our theme.

155
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:25,410
However, it's fairly easy to implement.

156
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:32,110
All you have to do is include the file and then modify the WP nav menu function in the examples below.

157
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:33,380
All right.

158
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:36,960
In the next lecture, will focus on the header and footer next.
