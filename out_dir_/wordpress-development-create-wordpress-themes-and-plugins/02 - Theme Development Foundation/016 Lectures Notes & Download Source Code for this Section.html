Thanks!</p><h4>Lecture Notes</h4><p><strong>Exploring WordPress &amp;Configuring the wp-config.php File</strong></p><ul><li><p>The <strong>wp-config.php </strong>file contains all your settings from database login details to debug settings and hashes.</p></li><li><p>Youre free to modify the <strong>wp-config.php</strong> file without having to worry about it being overwritten in future updates.</p></li><li><p>The <strong>wp-includes</strong> folder contains functions and classes used throughout WordPress. The <strong>wp-admin</strong> file handles everything on the admin side of WordPress.</p></li><li><p>The <strong>wp-content</strong> folder contains all content created by the user and also stores all plugins and themes.</p></li></ul><p><strong>File Headers</strong></p><ul><li><p>The absolute minimum requirement for WordPress to recognize your theme officially is by creating 2 files named <strong>style.css </strong>and<strong> index.php</strong> along with a file header.</p></li><li><p>A<strong> file header</strong> is a block comment placed at the top of your files to let WordPress know more about your theme/plugin.</p></li><li><p>The information presented in a file header called meta-information. Meta-informat is formatted as <strong>name: value</strong></p></li><li><p>A <strong>Text Domain </strong>is a unique ID for your translations.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Functions File &amp;ActionHooks</strong></p><ul><li><p>WordPress will search for a file called<strong> functions.php</strong>. This file is completely optional. You can add logic to do heavy lifting behind the scenes.</p></li><li><p>The developer tools allow you to diagnose and debug your site. The console tab will output any messages and errors related to your site.</p></li><li><p>Action hooks allow you to hook into certain events. If an event occurs, then any functions that hook into the event will be triggered.</p></li><li><p>Its important that you prefix your functions, classes and variables so you can avoid any naming conflicts with other code from plugins and the WordPress core.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Loading Styles &amp; Scripts with Enqueues</strong></p><ul><li><p>Its always important to register scripts/stylesheets before enqueueing them. Registering will let WordPress know about your files while enqueueing will instruct WordPress to lose the files.</p></li><li><p>Prefix your file handle names to avoid collision and naming conflicts with other plugins/themes.</p></li><li><p>Use the <strong>wp_head </strong>and <strong>wp_footer </strong>functions to instruct WordPress where to load your files.</p></li><li><p>Its important that you never override WordPress default scripts such as jQuery.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Caching Issues</strong></p><ul><li><p>Caching is when the browser stores copies of your CSS, JS and image files for page reloads. This increases performance and saves bandwidth.</p></li><li><p>Caching is great for production, but not ideal for development. You would have to clear the cache every time a change was made to a file.</p></li><li><p>WordPress allows you to specify a version for a file to force the browser to load the latest version.</p></li><li><p>Its good practice to create a <strong>constant </strong>to determine if a theme/plugin is in development mode.</p></li></ul><p><strong>AddingDummyContent</strong></p><ul><li><p>FakerPress allows you to generate fake content. Make sure you create fake users, terms and posts.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Menu Support</strong></p><ul><li><p>You can use WordPress built-in features by calling the<strong> add_theme_support()</strong> function and pass in the feature youd like to take advantage of.</p></li><li><p>Once the menu feature is active, then you can register a menu using the <strong>register_nav_menu() </strong>function.</p></li><li><p>After a menu has been registered you can display it using the <strong>wp_nav_menu()</strong> function. If you have a menu with CSS classes for each item, then youll need to use a custom walker to output those classes.</p></li><li><p>WordPress provides a few functions for translating strings. If WordPress doesnt find a translation, then WordPress will return the string as is.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Aside:Menu Walkers</strong></p><ul><li><p>Walkers are a general programming concept and not specific to WordPress. Theyre a way to loop through a nested array no matter the depth.</p></li><li><p>WordPress provides a base walker class that can be built on top. Most areas in WordPress uses walkers to loop through a data structure.</p></li><li><p>The <strong>start element</strong> and <strong>end</strong> <strong>element</strong> will loop through each individual item.</p></li><li><p>The <strong>start level</strong> and <strong>end level</strong> functions will be called during the beginning and ending of the data structure.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Creating Header &amp;Footer Areas</strong></p><ul><li><p>Use the <strong>get_header() </strong>and <strong>get_footer()</strong> functions to load the header and footer sections of your template respectively.</p></li><li><p>WordPress requires a certain naming convention for the header (<strong>header.php</strong>) and footer (<strong>footer.php</strong>) files.</p></li><li><p>If you have multiple header/footer files, then you can pass in an extension. WordPress</p></li><li><p>The <strong>body_class() </strong>function will load additional classes to the <strong>&lt;body&gt;</strong> tag.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Creating Sidebar and Widget Areas</strong></p><ul><li><p>Sidebars can be placed inside their own template files called<strong> sidebar.php</strong>. You can grab a sidebar using the function <strong>get_sidebar()</strong>.</p></li><li><p>Sidebars also follow the same naming conventions as the header and footer.</p></li><li><p>Its important that you keep your HTML/CSS for the widgets minimal as it can be hard to maintain with WordPress.</p></li><li><p>Make sure to check if a sidebar is active using the<strong> is_active_sidebar() </strong>function.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Formatting the Search Form</strong></p><ul><li><p>WordPress will search for a file called<strong> searchform.php</strong> and use it as a template for the search form displayed inside the search widget.</p></li><li><p>If the template is not found WordPress will automatically call the function <strong>get_search_form() </strong>which will generate a search form.</p></li><li><p>Its important that you set the method to <strong>GET </strong>and that the input field has a <strong>name </strong>of <strong>s</strong>.</p></li></ul><p><strong>The Loop</strong></p><ul><li><p>The Loop is a way to allow developers to loop through an array of posts. The number posts in an array varies from page to page.</p></li><li><p>In order to use post thumbnails you have to add support for it by calling<strong> add_theme_support( post-thumbnails );</strong></p></li><li><p>Template tags are functions that will retrieve information about the current page or post. They can be used inside or outside a loop.</p></li><li><p>Beware of using <strong>the_date()</strong> inside the loop. There are a lot of problems that come with this function. Its better to use the<strong> get_the_date() </strong>function instead.</p></li><li><p>Post thumbnails come in various sizes. By default there 4 size aliases that WordPress defines for you. The original size of an image can be grabbed by using the full size alias.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Template Parts</strong></p><ul><li><p>Template parts are a way to split up your template that can be reusable.</p></li><li><p>The <strong>get_template_part()</strong> function has 2 parameters. The first parameter is the generic template and the second is the specialized template.</p></li><li><p>The generic template can be considered the fallback template if the specialized template cant be found.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Template Tags</strong></p><ul><li><p>Template tags are functions that will output or process data. This helps separate logic and design in your templates.</p></li><li><p>Most template tags are capable of detecting if theyre inside a loop and will use the current post in the iteration to grab the data.</p></li><li><p>Beware of using <strong>the_date()</strong> inside the loop. There are a lot of problems that come with this function. Its better to use the <strong>get_the_date() </strong>function instead.</p></li><li><p>Post thumbnails come in various sizes. By default there 4 size aliases that WordPress defines for you. The original size of an image can be grabbed by using the <strong>full</strong> size alias.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Pagination</strong></p><ul><li><p>WordPress provides 2 functions for pagination which are the <strong>previous_posts_link()</strong> and <strong>next_posts_link()</strong> functions.</p></li></ul>
