1
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:12,540
We're going to start things off by creating a theme, as I stated previously, this course does not

2
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:16,820
focus on most of the HTML access and JavaScript provided to you.

3
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:21,150
This is because WordPress is very flexible when it comes to developing themes.

4
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:24,540
With that said, I already have a static template ready.

5
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:28,460
You can download this template in the resource section of this lecture.

6
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:31,580
This template was built with version four of Bootstrap.

7
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:35,280
I've done nothing to this template that makes it WordPress ready.

8
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:40,380
I will walk you through every step to convert it from a static template into a WordPress theme.

9
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:43,710
If you have a template ready, then feel free to use it.

10
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:48,090
You don't have to make any access or HTML changes at this moment.

11
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:50,070
Any kind of template will work.

12
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:55,110
If you're new to WordPress development, then I recommend you use the template I provide.

13
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:57,570
Let's take a look at some of the pages.

14
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:59,370
Let's you the home page.

15
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:01,920
As you can see, everything is pretty standard.

16
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:06,090
We have a header puter sidebar and a list of posts.

17
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:12,210
Everything that you see here will be turned into a fully functional theme while the design is simple

18
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:12,810
and clean.

19
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:14,040
Don't let that fool you.

20
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:16,620
We're going to make this thing very flexible.

21
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:23,040
Now that we have an idea of what we're going to create, it's time to start coding, open the text editor

22
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,570
of your choice and point it to the WordPress directory we installed in the previous lecture.

23
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:33,840
Inside the WordPress installation navigate to WP dash content slash themes.

24
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:38,100
This is where WordPress will search for theme files from the start.

25
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:41,550
WordPress has already pre-package some themes for you.

26
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,600
We want to keep our theme separated from the rest of the themes.

27
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,120
So create a new folder called Udemy.

28
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:53,210
It's required that you create a folder for your theme.

29
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:56,160
This is so themes don't conflict with each other.

30
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:59,730
It's also great for organization inside this folder.

31
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:01,910
We will have to create two files.

32
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:06,500
The first file is styled that success and the second file is indexed.

33
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:16,850
These are the only two files required by WordPress to create a theme, the style access file is where

34
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:19,100
we will place or file header information.

35
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:25,520
A file header is just a comment block placed at the very top of the style that Keith's file that describes

36
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:25,980
our theme.

37
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:30,940
Let's open this file and create a file header in the resource section.

38
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:34,190
I provide a link to more information about the file header.

39
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:40,220
The file header is a blocked comment placed at the top of the file that has meta information about a

40
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:40,890
theme or plug.

41
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:44,770
I'll explain more in just a moment, but let's see this in action.

42
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:51,710
Scroll down to the theme file, header, example, section copy and paste this into the style that CSFs

43
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:52,040
file.

44
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:59,590
I'm going to remove most of this info except the theme name change this value to you.

45
00:02:59,590 --> 00:02:59,920
To me.

46
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:08,960
That's it, this is the absolute minimum requirements for a theme, go to your WordPress admin dashboard

47
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:14,240
and navigate to appearance themes and empty blog with the theme name, you should appear.

48
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:17,960
You can actually activate this theme and start using it.

49
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:21,560
If you did everything right, then you should receive no errors.

50
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:24,080
Let's go to the front end of the site.

51
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,940
You will see an empty page.

52
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:29,920
However, WordPress throws no errors because we did everything required.

53
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:35,900
If you take a look at the source code, then you will find that WordPress added absolutely nothing because

54
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:36,980
that's our team's job.

55
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:41,160
As you can see, WordPress gives you complete control over your theme.

56
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:43,370
Let me prove this even further.

57
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:46,960
Open the index top file and add the text.

58
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:47,810
Hello, world.

59
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:56,350
Refresh the front page and you will now see it outputted WordPress is very smart and will automatically

60
00:03:56,350 --> 00:03:59,230
load this file without us having to write any logic.

61
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:04,340
The index top file can be thought of as the default template for WordPress.

62
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:08,240
There are various templates we can create, but we'll cover that later.

63
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:11,590
I'm going to temporarily switch back to the theme.

64
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:12,610
Twenty seventeen.

65
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:18,510
Then I'm going to delete the index file.

66
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:31,630
I'm going to refresh the admin things page and you'll notice that the broken theme section appears below.

67
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:35,930
It's telling us that the index template file is missing.

68
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:41,000
WordPress is capable of finding out this information, even though this team is inactive.

69
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:48,600
The absolute minimum requirement for creating a WordPress theme is the style that iest index files and

70
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,890
the file header with just the name of a theme.

71
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:57,560
I'm going to create the index file again so we don't see this broken theme section.

72
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:03,550
Let's go back to the file header in the style that file.

73
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:05,680
Let me go over what's going on.

74
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:12,790
When WordPress retrieves a list of themes in your WordPress installation, it'll go to the WP dash content

75
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:14,020
slash themes folder.

76
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:19,720
Each theme should have its own folder, and WordPress will go through each one and look for a file name

77
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,130
style that counts.

78
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:27,160
If this file is available, then WordPress will scan the contents of this file and look for something

79
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,210
called a file header.

80
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:34,620
If a file header is available, WordPress will then extract each piece of information from that header.

81
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:38,590
The format is the name followed by a colon and then the value.

82
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:44,590
The data inside this comment is what WordPress calls meta information for theme's.

83
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:46,680
The only thing you need is the theme name.

84
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:50,570
I'm going to rehab the meta information we previously removed.

85
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:52,660
Let's go over this one by one.

86
00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:57,840
The thing, Urai is a link to where users can view where your theme can be found.

87
00:05:57,850 --> 00:06:03,630
Officially, I'm going to remove this piece of information, feel free to keep or remove it as well.

88
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:07,000
The author is the name of the creator of this theme.

89
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:11,550
This can be your own personal name, or if you're on a team, then the name of your team.

90
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:14,890
I'm going to set this to Jack, the author.

91
00:06:14,890 --> 00:06:19,600
Uteri is the URL to your own personal site or your URL to your team's site.

92
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:24,850
I'm going to set this to https coingate you to me dot com.

93
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:33,250
The description is a brief summary about your theme, let's get this to a simple bootstrap WordPress

94
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:33,520
theme.

95
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:45,410
The version is the current version of this theme, since this is a brand new theme, will be setting

96
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:46,670
this to one point zero.

97
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:49,580
You can use whatever version schematic you want.

98
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:54,060
WordPress doesn't force you to stick any specific version schematic.

99
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:58,550
The license is simply the name of the license you'll be using.

100
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,830
I'm going to leave this as is for now, will be going over licenses later in this course.

101
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:09,590
The license uteri is the URL to where the user can find more information about the themes.

102
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:15,310
License the tags is the comma separated list of words that describe your theme.

103
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:21,280
This piece of information is used by WordPress as theme repository to help users find your theme.

104
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:27,590
If you plan on uploading your theme to WordPress dog, then setting this piece of information is important.

105
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:32,210
I don't plan on uploading this to the repository so we can remove this.

106
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:36,020
The last property we can set is the text domain.

107
00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:40,370
The text domain is very important when it comes to translating our theme.

108
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:45,410
You can think of the text domain as a unique idea for our translations.

109
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:50,030
It's common practice to set the text domain to the same name as your folder.

110
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,620
In our case, we're going to send it to you.

111
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:59,600
Me, I promise you will be going more over what the text domain does and its role in WordPress development

112
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,580
later in the course.

113
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:07,430
For now, just know that if you want to make your themes or plugins translate ready, then set the text

114
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:10,400
domain to something unique right below.

115
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:12,110
There's this small bit of text.

116
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:14,570
You do not have to add this bit of information.

117
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:20,900
Authors usually use this space to add in more info about the theme, such as license info or developer

118
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:21,290
notes.

119
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:26,210
WordPress will not bother scanning this part of the file, so you do not have to worry about it.

120
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,120
I'm going to remove this bit.

121
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:36,450
Let's go back to the Themes admin page and refresh the page, you can click on the theme and you will

122
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:38,610
now see some of our information displayed.

123
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:42,570
As you can tell, so far, WordPress handles a lot for us.

124
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:48,750
If you'd like to know more about file headers, then I highly suggest you read the Codex page I provided

125
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:49,140
earlier.

126
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:52,680
This page details what metadata you can create.

127
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:56,780
You'll notice that it provides information about creating plug ins.

128
00:08:57,180 --> 00:09:01,600
I want you to ignore this for now, as will be developing plug ins in a future section.

129
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:05,360
There's one last thing I want to do before I in this election.

130
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:11,230
While not required, WordPress will search for a file called Screenshot Dot PNG.

131
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:17,400
This file is basically a screenshot of your theme that will be displayed on the admin side of WordPress

132
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:19,200
and the resource section.

133
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:21,900
I provide a screenshot you can use for our theme.

134
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:25,440
Upload it to the Yuta missing directory we just created.

135
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:37,750
You can now refresh the themes admin page and you will now see our screenshot being displayed.

136
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:40,840
You can create your own screenshot if you like.

137
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:45,360
The recommended size for a screenshot is 880 by 660.

138
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:48,940
However, you should double the size for retina devices.
