1
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:13,100
Right now, all we have is empty white space as our theme, it's not very flexible, nor does it look

2
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:13,580
appealing.

3
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:14,810
Let's change that.

4
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:22,040
Earlier, I asked you to download the static version of our theme, open up that zip file inside the

5
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:24,070
unity theme folder we created.

6
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,840
Let's create a sub folder called Assets.

7
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:32,119
Unzip the contents of the static template into this folder.

8
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:38,440
I'm also going to add the HTML in there as well so we can use it for reference throughout this course.

9
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:43,950
It's important to note that WordPress doesn't require you to have this folder structure.

10
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:50,210
The only files WordPress requires are the index top end style that counts files.

11
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:52,940
The folder structure is completely up to you.

12
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:56,270
I want my theme to look like the static version.

13
00:00:56,690 --> 00:01:03,740
The first step is to have WordPress load the HTML, open the index, the HTML file inside the assets

14
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:04,050
folder.

15
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:08,300
Copy and paste the contents into the index top template.

16
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:16,310
Obviously, this won't work, but it's a good starting point if you refresh the homepage, you'll notice

17
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:17,710
that the site is pretty broken.

18
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:23,750
If you press F 12 on your keyboard, then you'll open up the developer tools for either Google Chrome

19
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:24,760
or Firefox.

20
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:30,080
You can then click on the console tab and you'll see that we're getting all these 404 errors.

21
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:33,970
If you're unfamiliar with the developer tools, then don't worry.

22
00:01:34,370 --> 00:01:39,570
Throughout this course, I'll be going over how the developer tools can help us develop better things.

23
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:41,520
Let me give you a brief overview.

24
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:46,150
The developer tools are a way for you to analyze and modify your site.

25
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:52,550
It can be intimidating to beginners, but it's actually quite simple to use once you know how to navigate

26
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:53,320
your way around.

27
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:54,760
Let's take it slow.

28
00:01:55,100 --> 00:02:01,520
The only thing you should know about the developer tools is the console tap the console will output

29
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,770
messages about your site.

30
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:07,280
It's mostly used for errors, but you can use it for other things if you wish.

31
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:11,720
Earlier I stated that this course doesn't really focus on JavaScript.

32
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:14,900
I assume you already know JavaScript henceforth.

33
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:17,390
I assume you already know about the console tab.

34
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:24,050
Taking another look at the console, we have all these 404 errors, meaning that a lot of the files

35
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:25,680
we want to load can't be found.

36
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:29,410
This is because the parts that are inputted are incorrect.

37
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:32,140
Technically, these parts are correct.

38
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:39,140
If you were to try to open the HTML file by itself, we could edit the index template and fix the links

39
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:41,240
to point to the new path for our theme.

40
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:43,520
But that is inefficient and not recommended.

41
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:52,170
We run into a couple of problems, such as users being able to actually change the default WordPress

42
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:56,130
folder structure to suit their needs, rendering our fixed links useless.

43
00:02:56,730 --> 00:03:04,350
We would also have to check if SSL is enabled, forcing us to check if the protocol is a or HTP.

44
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:10,930
Lastly, you'll end up loading all stylesheets and scripts on every page, even if we don't need them.

45
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:16,170
There are just too many disadvantages to hard coding the Urals into the template.

46
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:24,610
If you wanted to, you can create the logic for this, but you don't have to because WordPress actually

47
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:29,360
handles this logic for us, it's something WordPress calls action hooks.

48
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,730
I'll explain what those are in just a moment.

49
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:36,550
Back inside the theme folder, create a new file called Functions.

50
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:45,360
This file is completely optional, but if you have it, then WordPress will automatically load this

51
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,000
file and execute any code within this file.

52
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,790
You don't have to do anything to set it up.

53
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:55,860
Be sure that you name this functions and not function.

54
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:01,140
I've had students in the past forget the S causing their code not to work.

55
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:05,070
The functions file can be thought of as your theme's logic.

56
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:11,580
If you would like to query the database at stylesheets process forms, check if the user is logged in,

57
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:14,030
then this is the file you'll want to edit.

58
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:18,750
I personally don't like to stuff my functions file with all my logic.

59
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:22,790
I like to have structure and separate everything into its own file.

60
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:24,750
So let's add some comments.

61
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:30,590
Will first create a section for variables or functions that must be available throughout our theme.

62
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:33,830
The second section will be for including any files.

63
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:36,930
The third section will be for any filters and action.

64
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:39,270
Hooks will discuss hooks very soon.

65
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:42,870
Lastly, will create a section for shortcuts.

66
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:46,970
Keep in mind, you don't have to structure your file like this.

67
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:50,250
This is just how I do it and how I recommend you do it.

68
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:52,860
Just to make sure everything is working.

69
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:55,530
Let's echo out a hello world message.

70
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:03,330
If you refresh the page, then you should see the message outputted onto the home page, something I

71
00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:07,860
want you to notice is that the Hello World message is outputted before the template.

72
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:12,440
We can now confirm that the functions file is loaded before the template.

73
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:17,920
Let's remove this because it's not good practice to echo out anything inside the functions file.

74
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:20,820
We can now begin using action hooks.

75
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:22,220
What are action hooks?

76
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,930
So a lot can happen throughout WordPress.

77
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:30,720
Typically you may want to use conditional statements to check when a certain action or event happens.

78
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:33,000
However, this isn't very efficient.

79
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:36,270
What will happen is that you will have a lot of nested code.

80
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:40,110
Instead, WordPress introduces something called Hooks.

81
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:45,550
A hook is a way for you to listen to an event and execute code when that event happens.

82
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:50,750
This is what WordPress calls the plugins API and events can be anything.

83
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:53,730
There are literally over a hundred different hooks.

84
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:59,790
There's a hook for the footer when an admin form is submitted, AJAX submissions and so much more.

85
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:03,870
We won't be going over all of them because it would just be too overwhelming.

86
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:06,510
If you don't understand, then don't worry.

87
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:08,720
You'll see how it works in just a moment.

88
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:13,080
We will definitely be going over some of the most commonly used ones, though.

89
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:17,570
In the resource section of this lecture, you'll find a link to the Hooke's API.

90
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:18,930
Let's check this out.

91
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:24,660
You'll notice there's a list for two kinds of Hooke's action hooks and filter hooks.

92
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:27,540
We'll be going over both throughout this course.

93
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:30,810
Let's take a look at the list of action hooks available.

94
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:32,700
Scroll around this page.

95
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,220
You'll see all the hooks available to us.

96
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:41,130
I know we haven't gone over how to use hooks yet, but just from looking at this list, do you think

97
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:45,090
you can spot the hook we need in order to add scripts and styles to our theme?

98
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:49,350
Most people would say WP head, but this is incorrect.

99
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:53,790
The correct hook is the one above it, which is WP and Q scripts.

100
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:56,370
Click on it and let's take a look at this hook.

101
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:58,950
This is what WordPress has to say about it.

102
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:05,910
WP and Q Scripts is the proper hook to use when in items that are meant to appear on the front end,

103
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:10,590
despite the name it is used for in cueing both scripts and styles.

104
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:16,230
Just by reading that, you know it is indeed the correct hook to use when adding scripts and styles.

105
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:22,590
So let's get started with using action hooks, open the functions file and under the hooks section,

106
00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:29,190
add the following code, add action WP and queue script Jiyu underscore NQ.

107
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:41,440
The add action function is a function that WordPress automatically defines and loads for you, you don't

108
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,920
need to do anything to make sure it's available to you.

109
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:48,510
This function has four parameters, but only the first two are required.

110
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:52,620
The first parameter is the name of the hook you want to access.

111
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:57,130
In our case, we want to access the WP and Qs scripts.

112
00:07:57,130 --> 00:08:00,100
Look, make sure you input this as a string.

113
00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:03,670
The second parameter is the name of the function you want to call.

114
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:08,510
When this hook is triggered, the other two parameters will be discussing in another lecture.

115
00:08:08,890 --> 00:08:10,840
For now, we only need the first two.

116
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:15,460
Currently we don't have this function defined, so we'll get an error.

117
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,110
Let's fix that quickly.

118
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:22,540
As I stated before, I don't like to add all my logic and code in one file.

119
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:26,020
So let's create a folder called Includes.

120
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:29,590
Within this folder, create another folder called Front.

121
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:37,950
The front folder will contain any code in logic pertaining to the front end of our site within this

122
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:40,650
folder, create a file called Incudes.

123
00:08:41,970 --> 00:08:44,760
Let's define the function we called from the action hook.

124
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:47,510
Great.

125
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:54,280
We're almost done now, we need to include this file, so let's go back to the functions file and under

126
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:57,400
the include section include the Q file.

127
00:08:57,940 --> 00:09:04,030
I'm going to use the get theme file path function to make sure we always get the correct path to this

128
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:04,380
file.

129
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:14,590
The get themed file path function does a couple of things.

130
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:19,790
First, it'll provide the absolute path to the current activated theme on the site.

131
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:24,210
Usually you can just pass in path without any functions.

132
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:29,050
But I have come across situations where P and WordPress were unable to find the file.

133
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:32,790
I always recommend providing the full sys path.

134
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:35,060
This function will take care of that for you.

135
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:38,170
The function has one parameter which is optional.

136
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:41,890
You can provide a file relative to your theme's path.

137
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:43,510
That's what we're doing here.

138
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:46,540
Just like the add action function.

139
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:50,620
You do not need to do anything to make sure this function is available to you.

140
00:09:51,010 --> 00:09:54,070
It is already loaded and created for you beforehand.

141
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,200
WordPress takes care of that for you.

142
00:09:56,620 --> 00:10:00,130
I'll be using this function wherever we include files.

143
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:05,560
If we did everything correctly, then we should be able to refresh the page without any errors.

144
00:10:05,890 --> 00:10:09,740
Since we have no errors, then that means we did everything correctly.

145
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,550
Let's go over how this works internally.

146
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:16,570
When a user makes a request, WordPress will begin loading its files.

147
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:21,010
Then it'll connect to the database and start deciding what needs to be loaded.

148
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:23,860
Your theme and plugins are loaded afterwards.

149
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:30,730
Once your theme is loaded, WordPress will look for a file named functions, not inside your theme folder.

150
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:36,100
Once this file is loaded, all code inside will begin execution line by line.

151
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:42,370
We use a function called an action that is supplied by WordPress, which tells WordPress, Hey, I'd

152
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:45,130
like to execute some code if a certain event happens.

153
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:52,900
In our case, we want to call the function Jiyu underscore and Q If the WP and Q Scripts event is fired,

154
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:54,040
that's about it.

155
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:59,430
There's a lot more going on, but I won't be going over the smaller details in this lecture.

156
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:03,240
The reason being is that it would be too overwhelming at the moment.

157
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:08,980
I've had students in the past asking me to explain Hooke's more in detail, but that's not necessary

158
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:09,580
at this point.

159
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:14,860
I promise I will go over how the Hooke's API works more in-depth in a future lecture.

160
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:20,980
For now, just understand that the ADD Action function will tell WordPress that you want to run a function

161
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:22,090
when an event happens.

162
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:25,060
If you don't fully understand, don't worry.

163
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:31,030
This is a function that we use often and I assure you that the more you use it, the better you'll get

164
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:31,510
used to it.

165
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:36,820
This won't technically work yet because we haven't told WordPress where to load these files.

166
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,810
We'll get to that in the next election.

167
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:45,910
One last thing before I wrap up this lecture, you'll notice that I named my Q function Jiyu underscore

168
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:49,240
and Q I prefixed the function with some initials.

169
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:54,370
It's common practice to prefix your classes and functions with the initials of your theme or name.

170
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:59,950
Throughout this course I'll be prefixing Jiyu underscore for every function we define.

171
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:02,380
The initials are for the name Udemy.

172
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:07,480
We do this because we don't want to run into any naming conflicts with other plugins.

173
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:12,400
In the next lecture, we'll take a look at adding styles to our pages through this hook.
