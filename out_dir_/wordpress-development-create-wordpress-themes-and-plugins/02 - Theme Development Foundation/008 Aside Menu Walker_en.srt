00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:13,520
Welcome to the first aside and aside, is a lecture that isn't necessary to watch, it's more of a bonus

2
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:13,870
lecture.

3
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:18,770
For more information about a particular topic, you're free to skip these lectures and come back to

4
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:20,630
them after you finish this course.

5
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:25,850
In this first assigned lecture, I'm going to show you how to create a Walker class.

6
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:32,390
In the previous lecture, I talked about how to create a menu using the WP now menu function.

7
00:00:32,659 --> 00:00:36,980
This function has one extra setting you can set, which is the Walker key.

8
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:41,930
Before we get into how the Walker key works, let's talk about Walker's in general.

9
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:44,990
Walker's aren't specific to just WordPress.

10
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,630
Walker's our general programming technique.

11
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:52,380
Basically, they are a class or function that takes care of looping through an array.

12
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:54,950
What's so special about Walker's?

13
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:57,460
It's that they will loop through nested arrays as well.

14
00:00:57,890 --> 00:01:02,930
It doesn't matter how deep an array is, a walker will loop through every value.

15
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,340
It's simple as that.

16
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:11,720
Now that we understand how Walker's work, let's create one ourselves, just like everything else,

17
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:18,300
we're going to put this code in a separate file inside the includes directory, create a file named

18
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:21,610
Custom Dash NAV Dash Walker B.

19
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:31,840
Inside this file, I'm going to create a class named Jiyu, underscore custom, underscore nav, underscore

20
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,380
Walker that extends the Walker NAV menu class.

21
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:44,020
All right, at this point, you may be wondering why are we using classes?

22
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:50,570
Well, walkers can only be created using object oriented programming, so using regular functions won't

23
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:50,930
work.

24
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:57,870
If you need to pass this video and brush up on your object oriented programming before proceeding the

25
00:01:57,890 --> 00:02:02,990
walk or nav menu class we just extended takes care of the heavy lifting for us all.

26
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:05,470
Talk more about this class and what it does soon.

27
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,400
But for now, let's use this class.

28
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:14,720
Even though it's empty, it'll work as it's back inside the index template search for the menu we created.

29
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:20,720
This array we pass into the WP nav menu function has an extra option called Walker.

30
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:22,340
Add that in now.

31
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:31,140
The value for this must be set to a new instance of the Walker class we created in this case, it would

32
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:35,360
be Jiyu, underscore custom, underscore Knab, underscore Walker.

33
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:37,380
This won't work just yet.

34
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,280
This is because WordPress doesn't know where to find this class.

35
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:45,630
Inside the functions file include the Walker class file.

36
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:54,560
Now that we have that set, let's refresh the homepage and see the final result.

37
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:59,900
If everything worked, then you should receive no errors and see the menu working normally.

38
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:05,390
While it may not seem like it, WordPress is using our Walker class to generate this menu.

39
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:11,840
Even though our class is empty, the class we're extending comes with some default style links and formatting,

40
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:14,410
which is similar to word press's default menu.

41
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:18,040
With that being said, leaving it like this isn't practical.

42
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:22,130
The point of creating a Walker class is to customize the menu.

43
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:23,360
So let's do that now.

44
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:29,270
Back inside the class, I'm going to create a public function called start level.

45
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:32,060
I'm also going to add in some parameters.

46
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:42,770
WordPress allows you to override the four functions inside the Walker class, each of these functions

47
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:47,880
determine when certain HTML is output, it will go through each of them one at a time.

48
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:50,440
The first function is the start level.

49
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:54,590
This function is called when WordPress begins looping through a nested array.

50
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,890
This function is passed in three arguments.

51
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:00,050
The first argument is the output.

52
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:03,950
You'll notice I'm prefixing this with an ampersand symbol.

53
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:06,980
This value is being passed in as a reference.

54
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:10,040
Usually you will be provided a unique value.

55
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:14,590
But since this is passed in as a reference, then we're not provided a unique value.

56
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:21,709
Instead, any changes we make to the output variable will change any instances of the output variable

57
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:24,170
you'll see that affects us soon enough.

58
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,770
Moving on, the second argument is the depth.

59
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:30,970
This is the depth of the menu being generated.

60
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:32,030
Right now.

61
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:36,130
Our menu has a depth of zero as there are no sub menu items.

62
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:39,770
Lastly, the third argument is the arguments.

63
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:44,320
This will be the values you pass into the WP now menu function.

64
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:47,510
This gives you complete control over your menu.

65
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:51,490
You can choose to use or ignore the values you pass in.

66
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:55,370
Now that we understand the basics, let's use this function.

67
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:58,970
In most cases you would just echo out the elements.

68
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:01,630
You want to be outputted, but that's not the case here.

69
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:08,000
Instead, you have to make changes directly to the output variable to properly output each HTML.

70
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:12,410
I'm going to keep things simple and set the output variable to help.

71
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:18,240
This is the incorrect way of doing things, but that's fine for now.

72
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,030
This is just an example.

73
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:23,330
I'm going to say my changes and refresh the page.

74
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:26,720
After some time, you'll notice that nothing really changes.

75
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,250
Our menu is still displaying as normal.

76
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:34,430
This is because the water class only gets applied to Nestande menu items.

77
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:38,020
First level menu items don't use the Walker class at all.

78
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:42,930
It's only when you have some menu items is when the Walker class will be used.

79
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:48,100
Right now I don't have any sub menu items so the class will not be used.

80
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:49,340
Let's change that.

81
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:55,720
I'm going to open the WordPress admin dashboard and navigate to the menus page on this page.

82
00:05:55,730 --> 00:06:00,560
I'm going to quickly add a sub menu item to any of these main level menu items.

83
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:08,340
Make sure to save your changes before proceeding, once that's done, refresh the page one more time.

84
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:13,190
If you look at the menu now, you'll see the hello message being outputted.

85
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:16,790
This will also break the menu in page, but that's fine.

86
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:18,600
Let's go back to our editors.

87
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:22,350
Obviously, this isn't the proper way of doing things.

88
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:27,840
Something I want to know is that whenever you make changes to the output variable, you should always

89
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:31,250
append the value rather than assigning a new one like we're doing here.

90
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:36,360
I'm going to change this into an unordered list tag and append the value.

91
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:44,460
The reason I'm creating an unordered list is because this function is called when the menu is about

92
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:45,250
to be generated.

93
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:50,430
This function gives you the opportunity to set things up before the actual menu was created.

94
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:55,150
You'll notice I'm not closing this tag either, since we're setting things up.

95
00:06:55,170 --> 00:06:59,600
We don't want to immediately close the tank before we see this in action.

96
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:02,250
I want to make sure WordPress is using this walker.

97
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:06,600
So I'm going to add a class named Special Dash Class.

98
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:15,180
This class isn't specific to WordPress or my theme, it's just a class I made up on the spot with that

99
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:20,370
set, refresh the page and see the final result the page should now be displaying.

100
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:26,580
Normally, even though we didn't close the unordered list tag, WordPress defaults to an unordered list

101
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:28,470
anyway, so it closes for us.

102
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:32,970
If I cover my mouse over the submenu, you'll see it appearing normally.

103
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,510
I'm going to right click and select, inspect.

104
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:38,490
I want to see the HTML.

105
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:44,430
As you can see, the Walker class is being used for the submenu because we have this unordered list

106
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:46,290
tag being generated with the class.

107
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:48,200
We specify that's great.

108
00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:54,900
We now have more control over the menu and can assign classes, IDs, attributes, etc..

109
00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:00,990
Let's learn how to control the rest of the HTML generated back inside the editor.

110
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:04,950
I'm going to create a public function called and Lovel.

111
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:19,300
Just like last time were passed in the same arguments with the same values, however, the output variable

112
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:22,620
contains all the HTML from the previous functions.

113
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:29,260
If we were to override this value than any HTML generated before, this function will cease to exist.

114
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:33,929
We'll keep it simple and just append a closing unordered list tag.

115
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:44,770
So that takes care of the before and after, the next step is to work on each individual link.

116
00:08:45,090 --> 00:08:48,410
This will require a little more work right above.

117
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:52,170
I'm going to create a public function called start element.

118
00:08:54,510 --> 00:09:00,600
This function has the same parameters as the previous functions with two additional add ons, the second

119
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:03,080
parameter contains the item object.

120
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:09,570
This object contains information related to the link itself, such as the euro title, et cetera.

121
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:12,570
Lastly, we have the ID.

122
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:16,830
This variable contains the ID for the menu item itself.

123
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:23,070
This may seem strange, but WordPress keeps track of all menu items by assigning them an ID.

124
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:27,100
You can use this to add special features by using their ID.

125
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:31,410
We won't be going that far, but you are free to use it if you like.

126
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:38,940
I'm going to start things off by appending a list tag to the output variable with a class of special

127
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:41,220
dash class dash item.

128
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:50,400
Then I'll append the variable arguments and access the value before.

129
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:59,650
You may be wondering where I'm getting this value, the arguments variable contains the values you set

130
00:09:59,650 --> 00:10:02,080
inside the NAF menu function.

131
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:06,450
In the resource section of this lecture, I provide a link to this function.

132
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:13,390
If you scroll down to the parameters, you'll find two keys called before and after, according to the

133
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:18,240
description you pass in text that will be placed before and after the link.

134
00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:23,620
Since we're creating the Walker class, we're responsible for outputting these values.

135
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:29,530
Technically, we didn't set these values, but it's always good practice to set them in your Walker

136
00:10:29,530 --> 00:10:29,920
class.

137
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:36,220
Regardless, WordPress does provide a way for plugin developers to override these values, but we'll

138
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:37,320
get to that soon enough.

139
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:43,810
Back inside the Walker class, I'm going to append both the before and after values.

140
00:10:48,770 --> 00:10:52,190
In between these two values, I'm going to set up an anchor link.

141
00:10:58,090 --> 00:11:03,110
First, let's start with setting up the ref attribute inside this attribute.

142
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:05,800
I'm going to set the value to item you are out.

143
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:17,400
The item variable contains information about the specific menu item in the loop, it's an object where

144
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:19,280
one of the properties is you are out.

145
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:25,290
If you're curious on how I know these values, then you can just use the print R function to output

146
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:25,760
the data.

147
00:11:26,070 --> 00:11:31,590
If you never know what values a certain object contains, then I always recommend you just output it.

148
00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:33,090
Moving right along.

149
00:11:33,090 --> 00:11:35,760
Let's add the text between these two tags.

150
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:40,950
I'm going to output the link before, link after and the title itself.

151
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:55,520
Like before the link, before and link after our values that can be set inside the WP now menu function,

152
00:11:56,010 --> 00:11:58,740
the title comes for the item object.

153
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:01,560
That's all we need to do for the opening element.

154
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:08,370
You'll notice I'm not closing the list tag that shouldn't be done here and said will need to create

155
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:11,040
a public function called end element.

156
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:23,240
This functions purpose is to close the element, which we'll do by closing the list tag.

157
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:33,640
That's it, we're finished with this class, there's a whole more we should do, but I'll cover that

158
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:33,970
soon.

159
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:37,670
This is usually the minimum set up you'll find yourself doing.

160
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:40,270
Let's go to the homepage and refresh.

161
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:43,750
After refreshing, you should see the menu working as usual.

162
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:50,380
If you inspect the element, then you should see that the special class item class is being applied.

163
00:12:50,890 --> 00:12:56,790
Not only is it applied to sub menu items, but it's also being applied to main level items.

164
00:12:57,010 --> 00:13:02,590
To be clear, the start level and end level functions can apply to sub menu items.

165
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:09,610
The start elements and end element functions get applied to all menu items, including main level ones.

166
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,100
This is why we see being applied here.

167
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:16,660
Now that we're finished with the Walker class, let's explore what else we can do.

168
00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:22,600
In the resource section of this lecture, I provide a link to the Walker documentation page.

169
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:26,110
This page goes into detail about what walkers can do.

170
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:29,110
Walkers don't apply to just menus.

171
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:32,980
They can also be used for creating other types of content.

172
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,860
More on that in just a moment.

173
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37,500
Let's read what WordPress has to say.

174
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:43,900
The Walker class was implemented in WordPress, two point one to provide developers with a means to

175
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:48,040
traverse treelike data structures for the purpose of rendering HTML.

176
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:55,210
This is just another way of saying of being able to loop through a nested array so you can output HTML.

177
00:13:55,570 --> 00:13:59,800
Let's scroll down to the very bottom to the section called Related Classes.

178
00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:04,810
Here is a list of WordPress classes that take advantage of the Walker class.

179
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:10,750
The difference between these classes and the Walker class is that the Walker class simply loops through

180
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:11,260
your data.

181
00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:13,300
It doesn't do anything with it.

182
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:17,620
These classes here take care of using that data and outputting HTML.

183
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:23,680
Let's click on the Walker Now menu class, which we extended in our custom walker class.

184
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:27,310
You won't find much written information in this case.

185
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:29,230
We'll have to study the code ourselves.

186
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:32,020
Click on the link to the file here.

187
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:35,650
You'll find the walker that WordPress uses to generate the menu.

188
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:40,480
As you may notice, there's a whole lot more going on than what we had in our own class.

189
00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:45,490
I won't be able to go over every little thing, but here's a few things you should know.

190
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:53,820
First, you'll find a lot of backslash tea and backslash n strings appearing in the HTML, the backslash

191
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:57,090
T tells the browser to tab the HTML.

192
00:14:57,510 --> 00:15:01,660
The Backslash N tells the browser to put the HTML on a new line.

193
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,290
These are used for formatting reasons.

194
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:10,010
You don't have to do this as the developer tools already take care of formatting your HTML.

195
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:15,090
With that being said, if you don't use these, then it's actually beneficial to you.

196
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:21,570
By removing whitespace, you're essentially making the file size smaller, which can allow for faster

197
00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:22,380
loading times.

198
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:24,860
It's up to you whether you want to use them.

199
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,750
The first function here is the start level.

200
00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:32,540
Just like in our own function, this will output an unordered list tag.

201
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:38,730
It'll also take the time to check if there should be whitespace and it'll take the time to apply certain

202
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:39,470
attributes.

203
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:43,530
There are some functions being used here that are WordPress specific.

204
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:48,990
If you're coming to this lecture after finishing this course, then you're most likely familiar with

205
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:49,780
what these do.

206
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,870
If not, that's perfectly fine.

207
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:56,250
I won't be explaining these functions in this lecture, but I will in the future.

208
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:59,040
One, keep in mind that this is an aside.

209
00:15:59,370 --> 00:16:01,730
You don't have to take this lecture right away.

210
00:16:02,010 --> 00:16:04,230
You can always come back to it any time.

211
00:16:04,890 --> 00:16:11,280
Moving on the end level, function takes care of closing the unordered list tag and checking for whitespace.

212
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:16,440
Afterwards, we have the start element function just like last time.

213
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:19,800
This will output a list tag with the link inside.

214
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:25,560
There's a whole lot more going on here, but it's mostly checking if certain attributes should be applied.

215
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:28,560
It'll also take care of generating classes.

216
00:16:28,950 --> 00:16:33,360
Once again, if you don't understand the functions being used here, then that's fine.

217
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:36,180
You'll learn about them as the course progresses.

218
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:41,040
Lastly, we have the NS element function which closes everything.

219
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:45,450
This is the default WordPress menu and will work in most situations.

220
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:52,290
If you ever need to override the default HTML markup, then you need to use a Walker class for the rest

221
00:16:52,290 --> 00:16:53,010
of this course.

222
00:16:53,130 --> 00:16:56,160
We're going to continue using the default Walker class.

223
00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:01,320
So I'm going to comment about the Walker key inside the WP naff menu function.

224
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:06,490
Once you've done that, let's move on to the next lecture.

225
00:17:06,810 --> 00:17:07,680
I'll see you there.
