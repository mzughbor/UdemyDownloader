1
00:00:07,630 --> 00:00:11,620
Let's take a look at how to add styles and scripts through our hook.

2
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:13,010
It's pretty straightforward.

3
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:16,780
There are only two steps required to add styles to our pages.

4
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:19,420
The first step is to register the style.

5
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:24,400
Registering styles simply means that you're telling WordPress that you have a style sheet and you would

6
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,610
like WordPress to know its location, along with other details.

7
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:33,310
In the resource section of this lecture, I'll provide a link to learn all about registering styles.

8
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:41,200
In order to register a style, we need to use the WP register style function under the notes section.

9
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:47,950
You'll see we're using this function correctly because it says Use the WP and Qs scripts action to call

10
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:48,610
this function.

11
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:51,930
Calling it outside of an action can lead to problems.

12
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:56,260
Since we're already doing that, it's safe to assume we can use this function.

13
00:00:56,650 --> 00:00:59,140
This function has two required parameters.

14
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:01,840
The first parameter is the handle name.

15
00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:05,560
The handle name can be thought of as a unique name or ID.

16
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:09,570
For reference, the second parameter is the source to the stylesheet.

17
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:14,740
Let's go back to the NQ function and call the WP Register style function.

18
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:23,360
Now we have to pass in a handle for the first parameter, if we go back to the index template, you'll

19
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:26,060
see we have quite a few stylesheets being loaded.

20
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:28,730
The first stylesheet is a Google font.

21
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:32,300
So let's call this handle Jiyu Google fonts.

22
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:40,370
Just like functions, it's also common practice to prefix our handles with some initials for the second

23
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:42,590
parameter, lets pass in the euro.

24
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:55,040
We're loading this font from a sudden so we can just paste the URL like so as a string.

25
00:01:56,430 --> 00:02:04,050
Next up is the Bootstrap Docs file, you'll need to call the WP register style function again, just

26
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:04,680
like before.

27
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,160
I'm going to use the same naming convention.

28
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:09,810
The name will be Jiyu Bootstrap.

29
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:18,460
Unlike the Font's, this file is located within our theme directory, will use WordPress to help us

30
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:20,270
generate a Eurail to this file.

31
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:24,790
There's actually a function that will always point to the current theme directory.

32
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:28,540
This makes it easier on us as we don't have to perform checks.

33
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:34,560
If the owner of the site changed the name of the theme directory right at the top of this function,

34
00:02:34,570 --> 00:02:39,400
I'm going to create a variable named Urai and set its value to the function.

35
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,510
Get the file.

36
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:41,050
You are right.

37
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:48,500
You do not have to pass in anything and you don't have to include any file to get this function to work,

38
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:52,210
this function is loaded and defined for you by WordPress.

39
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:57,340
You may notice this function has a similar name to the get the file path function.

40
00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:03,620
The difference between these two functions is that you are riperton will actually get the web URL the

41
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:08,260
non-driver and get the system path with this dirigibles set.

42
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:11,480
I'm going to pass it into the function right after this.

43
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:19,850
I'm going to append the path relative to our theme folder, which as assets exists, bootstrap access.

44
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:24,420
The first two parameters are required.

45
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:28,850
These next three are optional, but the last two aren't used as often.

46
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:31,580
The third parameter is what's most important.

47
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:34,730
The third parameter is an array of dependencies.

48
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,810
Sometimes your styles may depend on another style sheet to load.

49
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:44,420
You simply pass in an array of panel names, and WordPress will take care of loading those style sheets

50
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:45,130
before this one.

51
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:49,920
If WordPress doesn't find a style sheet, then this style sheet will not be loaded.

52
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:55,820
For example, if I wanted the Google font to load before the style sheet, then I could pass in the

53
00:03:55,820 --> 00:04:00,740
handle name like so I'm not too worried about dependencies so we can leave this out.

54
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:05,320
Now that we have that finished, I'm going to register the rest of the styles.

55
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:06,860
It's the same as before.

56
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:15,430
Post the video if you need to have what I have, if we refresh the page, you'll notice that this won't

57
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:16,230
work just yet.

58
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,839
We've only registered our styles.

59
00:04:19,269 --> 00:04:23,120
Now we must tell WordPress we would like to add it to our page.

60
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:27,150
We now have to use a function called WP and Q style.

61
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:32,160
I've also included a link to this function in the resource section of this lecture.

62
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:38,020
This function only has one required parameter, which is the handle name of the style we registered

63
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:38,420
earlier.

64
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:43,760
You'll notice the other parameters are similar to the WP register style function.

65
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:49,300
However, these are only available just in case you forget to register a style.

66
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:51,540
You should always register a style.

67
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:57,190
Though the difference between registering and cueing a file is that registering will tell WordPress

68
00:04:57,190 --> 00:05:00,250
about a stylesheet and make it available to be called later on.

69
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:06,280
While in queuing will instruct WordPress to load our stylesheet onto the page right away.

70
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:11,580
You will not always want to in Kiwa style on every page as it is inefficient.

71
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:17,710
There's also plugins out there that will sometimes scan registered siles and perform actions such as

72
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:20,440
modifying and concatenating style sheets together.

73
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:24,070
So it's best to register first, then NQ.

74
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:31,780
Let's nq the font stylesheet right after the register functions called the function WP and Kusile and

75
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:34,660
pass in the handle name Jiyu Google Fonts.

76
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:37,180
Let's do this for all the stylesheets.

77
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,410
All right, we're almost done.

78
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:54,270
I promise there's only one last thing we need to do in order for all this to work.

79
00:05:54,570 --> 00:06:00,600
If we go back to the index template, you'll notice we haven't told WordPress where to load our stylesheets.

80
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,330
Our template is pure HTML.

81
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:08,830
WordPress doesn't magically scan our files and insert everything in the appropriate place.

82
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,980
We have to tell WordPress where to load our files.

83
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:13,360
So let's do that.

84
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:16,100
Go to the head section of the template.

85
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:20,520
We are going to replace the stylesheets and call the function WP head.

86
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:29,170
The WP head function is a function defined by WordPress, this function simply tells WordPress that

87
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:34,100
this is the spot where themes and plugins can NQ their stylesheet and script files.

88
00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:37,080
Let's refresh the page and we should see it working.

89
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:40,830
If you see something similar to what I see, then you're good to go.

90
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:44,110
Let's double check some things and open the console.

91
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:47,720
You'll notice we get a lot of errors, but we'll fix this soon.

92
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:52,600
What I want you to look for is any 404 errors related to stylesheets.

93
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:56,190
If you don't see any, then that means you loaded everything correctly.

94
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:58,690
We can now begin adding scripts.

95
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:02,630
Adding a script file is almost the same as adding a stylesheet.

96
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:07,210
However, unlike stylesheets, we can load script files in the footer.

97
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:13,720
If we take a look at the template, we have all our scripts being loaded into the footer, just like

98
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:16,110
adding files inside the head tag.

99
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:21,370
We also have to call a function from the footer to instruct WordPress where to load files in the footer

100
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:28,330
at the very bottom of the template right before the closing body tag called the WP footer function.

101
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:37,910
This function allows our theme and other plug ins to load their files into the footer.

102
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:44,540
All right, now that we have that set up, let's go to the NQ function and start adding our scripts.

103
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:51,080
Just like stylesheets, we have to register our scripts in the resource section of this lecture.

104
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:54,420
I provide a link to the WP Register, a script function.

105
00:07:54,890 --> 00:07:58,120
Let's take a look at what WordPress has to say about this function.

106
00:07:58,730 --> 00:08:04,610
As you can see, only the first two parameters are required and they're basically similar to the WP

107
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:05,900
register style function.

108
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:10,540
Back inside the index template, we include a script called Plugins.

109
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:14,090
Let's add this script to the footer through the NQ function.

110
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:18,980
Let's call the WP Register script function and pass in a handle name.

111
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:21,890
The handle name will be Jiyu plugins.

112
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:29,560
I don't have to worry about name conflicts here because stylesheets and scripts are stored separately,

113
00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:32,200
the second parameter is the source.

114
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,679
It's the same as last time.

115
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:37,580
You just use the URAI variable and append the path.

116
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:42,789
The path would be assents exact plug ins, James.

117
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:51,510
Now, in most cases, you always want to load your scripts in the footer to allow our content to be

118
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:52,980
loaded before our scripts.

119
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:55,730
So how do we make our script load in the footer?

120
00:08:56,400 --> 00:09:01,340
Let's go back to the documentation and look at the WP Register script function again.

121
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:07,730
You'll notice that the fit parameter determines whether or not a script is loaded in the footer by default.

122
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:08,340
It doesn't.

123
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:14,030
We have to pass in a true boolean value so that we can load the script inside the flitter.

124
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:21,080
Let's go back to the function and start using this, the third parameter is this scripts dependencies.

125
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:25,920
In some cases your scripts will depend on the functionality of another script.

126
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:30,920
You have to pass in an array of handling things for WordPress to make sure those scripts are loaded

127
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,110
first before this one.

128
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:37,910
In our case, we don't have to worry about dependencies, so we'll just passing an empty array.

129
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:41,290
The fourth parameter is the version of the script.

130
00:09:41,570 --> 00:09:47,810
If you update your script frequently, this can be a useful parameter to say this is because a lot of

131
00:09:47,810 --> 00:09:53,840
WordPress sites have cache enabled by updating the version, you'll force WordPress to load the latest

132
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,000
version of the script.

133
00:09:55,580 --> 00:10:00,530
I'm going to set this to false as I don't really need to worry about versioning for this script.

134
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:05,720
The whole point of this part of the lecture is to load the script into the footer, which is the fifth

135
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:06,770
and final parameter.

136
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:08,960
All you have to do is pass in.

137
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,630
True, that's it.

138
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:16,910
Let's include the plugins file using the WP and Qs script function and see if it loads on the page.

139
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:30,400
You'll notice that WordPress also loads its top now bar for users who are logged in after confirming

140
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:34,240
that it loads, why don't you pause the video and load the rest of the scripts?

141
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:38,080
Be sure to remove the script tags after you include them.

142
00:10:41,130 --> 00:10:47,010
All right, so I basically just registered and include the rest of our scripts, you'll notice that

143
00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:49,730
I also removed their inclusions from the footer.

144
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:55,620
If I refresh the page, you'll see that everything is loaded correctly except for one thing, Jacquier.

145
00:10:56,460 --> 00:11:02,790
We also get a couple of errors inside the console thing that Jake query isn't loaded or defined in the

146
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:03,670
NQ file.

147
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:06,840
I didn't bother registering or even skewing it, but one.

148
00:11:07,530 --> 00:11:13,800
Let's go back to the WordPress documentation and take a look at the WP Register a script function on

149
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,380
the contents sidebar.

150
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:18,090
I want you to click core registered scripts.

151
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:23,880
You'll be taken to a part of the page that tells you that WordPress registers a number of scripts that

152
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,650
are commonly used by developers.

153
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:33,300
WordPress automatically registers a large number of scripts libraries like Jaquie or UI and underscore

154
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:36,710
if we scroll down long enough, you'll find a query.

155
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:41,990
So all we have to do is in queue this script before and cueing anything else.

156
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:43,140
Let's do this now.

157
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:55,620
Refresh the page, and if you did everything right, then you should see that any errors related to

158
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:56,940
GAO query are now gone.

159
00:11:57,450 --> 00:12:01,620
Now, before I end this lecture, I want to say one very important thing.

160
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:06,250
Never, ever override word press's default scripts, including query.

161
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:12,120
There are some developers out there that like to include their own version of jury, which may seem

162
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:14,530
great and all, but it's really not a good idea.

163
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:17,640
You aren't the only developer using GE query.

164
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:23,670
If developers constantly use their own versions of scripts, then this could break a client site and

165
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:25,230
can cause hours of debugging.

166
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:30,240
It's so much better to just use a J.A.G. version that's consistent throughout the site.

167
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:37,710
Inside the HTML template, we use a different version of GE query, but that's only for the email template

168
00:12:37,710 --> 00:12:40,100
and not meant to be used for the WordPress theme at all.

169
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:44,220
So please don't try and override WordPress query.
