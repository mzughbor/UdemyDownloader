1
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:14,440
WordPress comes bundled with various files, but the most important file is the WP config file.

2
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:18,110
At the heart of every WordPress site is the configuration file.

3
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:21,670
Let's open the WP config file.

4
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:25,580
It can be found in the root directory of your WordPress installation.

5
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:32,500
This file basically contains all your core settings, such as the database, login details, security

6
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:34,360
hashes, salts, etc..

7
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:40,720
In the resource section, I provide a link to the WP Config Codecs Documentation Page.

8
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:46,450
This page contains all the information that you'll need to know to make changes to the config file.

9
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:52,870
Unlike other core files, you're allowed to edit this file without much consequence when WordPress is

10
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:53,320
updated.

11
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:57,740
There are a lot of settings here, but we won't be going over most of them.

12
00:00:58,090 --> 00:01:03,400
You don't need to worry about modifying this file much as the default settings are already optimized

13
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:04,030
for your site.

14
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:07,100
WordPress takes care of this automatically for you.

15
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:10,410
However, there is one setting we should modify.

16
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:17,180
Go back to the config file and search for something called WP underscore debug by default.

17
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:19,160
This value is set to false.

18
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:21,160
Let's change this to true.

19
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:29,330
What this will do is display any errors you receive when your coat, it will provide more information

20
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:30,450
to help you with debugging.

21
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:36,860
I highly recommend you always do this during the development phase of any plugin or theme when you're

22
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:37,970
ready for production.

23
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:40,370
Be sure to change this back to false.

24
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:44,830
If this value doesn't exist, then you can just add it in by default.

25
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,320
It'll always be false.

26
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:53,720
So during installation, this file was automatically created for you if you were to open the zip file.

27
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:57,820
You'll notice there never was a WP config file.

28
00:01:58,070 --> 00:02:01,640
Instead, there's a file named WP config sample.

29
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:04,450
Let's open this file.

30
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,280
It can be found in our installation of WordPress.

31
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:15,200
This file is just a dummy file that we can rename to WP Config File and use it as the main config file

32
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:17,720
it's provided to us just in case.

33
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:22,690
WordPress is unable to generate this file for us during its user friendly installation.

34
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:27,230
You simply just have to change the values of these constants.

35
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:32,590
If you're unsure what each value means, then refer to the documentation for more information.

36
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:36,560
We don't have to do this since the default installation worked for us.

37
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:40,610
One thing I do want to know is the authentication section.

38
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:43,370
You can find it if you scroll down just a bit.

39
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:48,640
If you have to manually create this file, then this section is super important.

40
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:53,020
These keys are used to hash out your passwords and sensitive data.

41
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:55,310
You're free to come up with your own keys.

42
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:59,650
But if you're not confident with what you came up with, then WordPress has you covered.

43
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:02,780
Go back to the documentation config page.

44
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:06,830
On the sidebar, you'll find a section called Security Keys.

45
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:08,230
For me, it's No.

46
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:14,750
One point for you'll find a link to an online generator that will generate random hard to crack keys.

47
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:15,890
Let's check it out.

48
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:16,940
On this page.

49
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,330
You'll see that we get a set of keys that we can use in our file.

50
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:24,800
You can refresh the page and you will always get a set of unique random keys.

51
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:30,380
You can simply copy and paste this into the WP config page PDF file like.

52
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:36,440
So keep in mind that these are values that once you set, you shouldn't change afterwards.

53
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:40,460
Otherwise you can cause problems with currently active accounts.

54
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:46,370
Just in case you can't find this link on the Codex page, then you can check out this blog comment right

55
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:46,820
above.

56
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:52,460
Inside this block, you'll see WordPress provides a link to the online generator as well.

57
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:57,080
That wraps up the topic on configuring BWP config file.

58
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:01,850
Feel free to explore this documentation for more information on this file.

59
00:04:02,210 --> 00:04:08,930
For our purposes, just setting up the WP debug constant to true is more than enough to get started.

60
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:14,840
Let's explore some of the other files and directories inside the root directory.

61
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,520
You'll find a couple of files here.

62
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:22,750
The files found inside the root directory determine what files should be loaded on every page request.

63
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:31,330
Next, we have these three folders called WP Dash Admin, WP Dash Content and WP Dash includes.

64
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:34,430
Let's start with a WP dash includes folder.

65
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:39,560
This folder contains classes and functions that help WordPress process requests.

66
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:44,870
It's important to understand that this is different from what you might find inside the root directory.

67
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:49,190
The root directory files help loads and set up WordPress.

68
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:55,850
The files inside the WP Dasch includes folder provide functions and classes that WordPress uses to process

69
00:04:55,850 --> 00:04:56,180
data.

70
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:00,770
A lot of the files inside this folder can't do anything by themselves.

71
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:08,960
For example, if I were to open the WP comments post HP file, you'll find a lot of logic being implemented

72
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:09,170
here.

73
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:12,470
This file will process commands for a blog post.

74
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:15,830
As you can see, it doesn't bother defining functions.

75
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:19,220
Instead, it just loads, files and prepares variables.

76
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:25,640
Inside the WP dash includes folder open the admin bar PDF file.

77
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:29,630
Inside this file you'll find a lot of functions to find here.

78
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:33,260
However, you won't find any logic being executed.

79
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:36,200
This file doesn't do anything by itself.

80
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:39,200
That goes for a lot of files inside this folder.

81
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:45,260
Moving on, the WP dash admin folder is another default folder and WordPress.

82
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:48,110
This folder handles its own requests.

83
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:55,370
Unlike the other parts of WordPress, WordPress uses the index we file to handle a majority of requests.

84
00:05:55,940 --> 00:06:02,090
However, if you visit the admin side of WordPress and the indexed free file doesn't handle anything.

85
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:08,510
Instead, WP Dash Admin is a directory that likes to be independent from the rest of the world.

86
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:09,200
Press corps.

87
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,990
All files here are just for the admin.

88
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:13,430
There's nothing much to it.

89
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:18,230
Honestly, the last folder is the WP dash content folder.

90
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:22,250
This folder will contain all plugins themes and uploads.

91
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:22,900
This is.

92
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:28,650
We will be working for the majority of this course because of that, I won't be talking too much about

93
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:30,010
this folder in this lecture.

94
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:36,690
What I will say is that WordPress will automatically add some plugins and themes, which can be a great

95
00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:39,780
way to understand how to build your own themes and plugins.

96
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:44,670
You are allowed to freely modify a lot of these files without much consequence.

97
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:52,650
Before I end this lecture, let's configure the server and the Zamp control panel navigate to Apache

98
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:54,720
config INR.

99
00:06:55,410 --> 00:06:58,690
This file contains settings for our environment.

100
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,580
There are three settings I want to change.

101
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:04,590
The first setting is the max execution time.

102
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:07,170
Search for it and set it to five hundred.

103
00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:15,660
This will allow our scripts to run for five hundred seconds, realistically, this should never be the

104
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:21,600
case, but if you ever decide to do something that is resource intensive, then you can avoid timeout

105
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:24,030
errors by setting this value to a high number.

106
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:27,690
The next value to set is the post max size.

107
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:30,240
Search for it and set it to 50 m.

108
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:36,900
This will allow us to submit large requests up to 50 megabytes.

109
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:40,010
There will be times where we will be submitting a lot of data.

110
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:42,800
So setting this to a high number is beneficial to us.

111
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:50,580
The last value set is the upload max file size to 50 M, which will allow us to upload files up to 50

112
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:51,190
megabytes.

113
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:52,820
That's it for now.

114
00:07:53,010 --> 00:07:58,200
By making these changes to our environment, we can now begin with developing plug ins and themes for

115
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:58,830
WordPress.

116
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:02,670
You will need to restart the server for these changes to take effect.

117
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,390
Do that before you move on to the next lecture.
