Please be sure to let me know if you have any questions. Thanks!</p><h4>LectureNotes</h4><p><strong>Getting Started with Gutenberg</strong></p><ul><li><p>WordPress provides a babel preset for processing code. This saves you time from having to set things up yourself.</p></li><li><p>The <strong>cross environment</strong> module will make sure any commands and settings you use will work with any platform.</p></li><li><p>You can set the <strong>watch</strong> property inside the <strong>webpack config</strong> file to force webpack to continuously watch your files for any changes and compile them.</p></li><li><p>Source maps are a way to convert compressed/minified/obscured JavaScript back to its original form.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Registering and Enqueueing the Block Assets</strong></p><ul><li><p>Use the action hook <strong>enqueue block editor assets</strong> to load your JS/CSS files for the Gutenberg editor.</p></li><li><p>The <strong>wp-i18n</strong> file has code related to translating strings on the front end.</p></li><li><p>The <strong>wp-element</strong> script provides functions for creating elements. Mainly for JSX.</p></li><li><p>The <strong>wp-components</strong> script provides the various components you can use in your own blocks.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Register Blocks</strong></p><ul><li><p>You dont have to store the contents of an imported file. You can import a file for the sake of executing the imported files code.</p></li><li><p>All code is stored under the global variable <strong>wp</strong>. The <strong>blocks</strong> object contains all the components registered under WordPress.</p></li><li><p>The <strong>registerBlockType</strong> function has 2 parameters. The first is the name of the block. The name should be formatted as <strong>namespace/name</strong>. The second parameter is the settings.</p></li><li><p>The Gutenberg code provided in WordPress is different from the code on Github. The Github version is the non compiled version. It has not been processed by babel or webpack.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Block Settings</strong></p><ul><li><p>Destructure objects to make your code readable. A common practice for Gutenberg blocks.</p></li><li><p>SVG stands for <strong>scalable vector images</strong>. Theyre images made up of code. You can use custom icons for your blocks by using SVG. Make sure your SVG images are JSX ready by converting them beforehand.</p></li><li><p>Youre allowed to submit up to 3 keywords. If you must have more than 3, then you can put multiple words in a single keyword.</p></li><li><p>The <strong>supports</strong> property will disable/enable any Gutenberg block features. Giving you more control over the functionality of your block.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Using the edit and save properties</strong></p><ul><li><p>The <strong>edit</strong> function should be used to render a UI in the editor. The <strong>save</strong> function should be used to render the final result of the block for the front end.</p></li><li><p>React applications are structured with components. Children components are responsible for telling the parent component if the data was updated. After an update has occurred, all children will be updated with the latest changes.</p></li><li><p>The <strong>props</strong> object will contain the data related to your block. Its filled with properties and methods that are constantly updated whenever the user interacts with the editor.</p></li><li><p>To add dynamic values in JSX, you need to use a pair of curly brackets with the value youd like to inject.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Inspector Controls</strong></p><ul><li><p>Inspector controls are the input fields on the sidebar of the Gutenberg editor.</p></li><li><p>You can <strong>return</strong> an array to have multiple root elements. If an <strong>InspectorControls</strong> component is in the array, Gutenberg will display the content on the sidebar.</p></li><li><p>WordPress provides dozens of generic components that you can take advantage of. They come with formatting and accessibility to your blocks.</p></li><li><p>The <strong>TextControl</strong> component will create an input field. The <strong>SelectControl</strong> component will create a dropdown field.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Sidebar:ES6 Rest and Spread Operators</strong></p><ul><li><p>The <strong>rest</strong> operator allows you to have a parameter that takes an unlimited amount of values and store them in an array.</p></li><li><p>The <strong>spread</strong> operator will take the values from an array/object and spread them to wherever you place it. Useful for merging objects/arrays.</p></li><li><p>The <strong>arguments</strong> object may look like an array, but its not a true array. You cant access the same methods and properties that come with arrays.</p></li><li><p>Gutenberg uses the <strong>rest</strong> and <strong>spread</strong> operators to allow for dynamic attributes in their components.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Attributes</strong></p><ul><li><p>Attributes are custom values for your block. They must be set and managed by you, the developer.</p></li><li><p>After setting your attributes, they can be accessed via the <strong>props.attributes</strong> object.</p></li><li><p>To update an attribute, you need to use the <strong>props.setAttributes</strong> function. Pass in an object with all the attributes youd like to update.</p></li><li><p>The attributes dont get saved after saving the post because the <strong>save</strong> function is not being saved properly. This is why you see <strong>Hello</strong> constantly. This will be taken care of in the next lecture.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Rendering the Block</strong></p><ul><li><p>Gutenberg constantly calls the <strong>edit</strong> function whenever the block or anything else is updated. The <strong>save</strong> function is called when the post is published or updated.</p></li><li><p>WordPress will save your content with your blocks surrounding in comments. The comments will help break your content back into blocks in the editor.</p></li><li><p>The <strong>selector</strong> property will tell Gutenberg where it can find the value for an attribute. The <strong>source</strong> will tell it what to take from that element based on the selector.</p></li><li><p>The <strong>type</strong> will tell Gutenberg what type of data it should expect to store in the database. This is optional.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Styling Blocks</strong></p><ul><li><p>SASS/SCSS is preprocessor with features like variables, conditional statements, etc. It can make your CSS easier to manage.</p></li><li><p>SASS cant be loaded on the browser. You need to able to compile it into CSS after youre finished. There are plenty of modules for Webpack and Node.js to accomplish this.</p></li><li><p>You can use multiple loaders by passing in an array to the <strong>use</strong> property.</p></li><li><p>Use the <strong>enqueue block assets</strong> hook to load scripts and stylesheets for the editor and front end. Its ideal to use it for loading stylings for your blocks.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Alignment Toolbar</strong></p><ul><li><p>WordPress provides components for adding a toolbar to your block. This is done with the <strong>BlockControls</strong> component.</p></li><li><p>The <strong>AlignmentToolbar</strong> is a component that will add an alignment toolbar to wherever you call it.</p></li><li><p>If you dont set a <strong>selector</strong> or <strong>source</strong>, then WordPress will store your attribute in the comments.</p></li><li><p>Its recommended that you store attributes in the comments for small or simple values. Store attribute values in the HTML when the data is complex.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Block Alignment</strong></p><ul><li><p>The <strong>BlockAlignmentToolbar</strong> component will create the UI for aligning your block in the editor.</p></li><li><p>The <strong>getEditWrapperProps</strong> function will run every time the block is updated. We use it to update the property thats wrapped around our block in the editor.</p></li><li><p>Bootstrap comes with classes for aligning your content. We use it to help us align the component in the template.</p></li></ul>
