1
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:10,480
It's time to get started with Guttenberg at this point.

2
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:16,580
You should be comfortable with Noad react and Westpac will be using these technologies to help us with

3
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:17,800
Gutenberg development.

4
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:22,650
If you're not comfortable with these concepts, then I recommend you check out the previous section.

5
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:25,770
Right now I'm looking at the Gutenberg editor.

6
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:27,730
Everything here is extendible.

7
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:31,310
There are two main areas you'll usually want to extend.

8
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:34,010
The first area is the content itself.

9
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:37,640
The content is made up of something WordPress calls Bloks.

10
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:41,390
It may not look like it, but every section here is a block.

11
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:43,880
Each block comes with its own settings.

12
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:46,760
I can even freely move them around if I wish.

13
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:50,500
WordPress provides a way to create your own blocks.

14
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:53,220
We'll take a look at how to do that in this section.

15
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:56,660
The other area you can extend is the sidebar.

16
00:00:56,930 --> 00:01:02,200
The sidebar contains information such as the category tags, status, etc..

17
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:04,950
We'll be looking at how to extend this as well.

18
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:11,480
Every area is extendible, but these are the two main areas you'll find yourself wanting to extend often.

19
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:14,160
Here is what we're going to do.

20
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:20,700
Earlier, we created a recipe, custom post type, we're going to create a blog that allows users to

21
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:22,530
input information about a recipe.

22
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:29,070
This will include information such as ingredients, cooking time, utensils, cooking experience and

23
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:29,760
a meal type.

24
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:34,120
The overall process for creating a block will look like the following.

25
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:37,050
First, you have to prepare your environment.

26
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:40,860
This step is optional, but this is how I prefer to do things.

27
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:43,560
And so I will teach you how to prepare your environment.

28
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:47,310
This is basically setting up web pack, react and bable.

29
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:50,220
Next you have to load in those files.

30
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:54,810
Gutenberg comes with a few hooks for making sure your access files are loaded.

31
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:58,200
Then you have to register your block once again.

32
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:00,470
WordPress makes this process easy.

33
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:03,700
All you have to do is call a few functions and you're set.

34
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:08,620
Once you've taken care of that, you will need to create the settings for your block.

35
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:12,550
This includes stuff like the title icon and form fields.

36
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:16,740
Lastly, you will need to tell Gutenberg how it should display your block.

37
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:23,390
Now that we have an overview of things, let's start with the first step that would be preparing the

38
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:29,180
environment inside the recipe, plug and directory, create a folder called Bloks.

39
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:37,170
We will be placing all our code related to blogs and the Gutenberg editor here, you don't have to name

40
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:39,390
your files or folders, anything special.

41
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,340
You can name this, whatever you want.

42
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:47,600
I also want to highlight that we're not placing this folder inside the includes or assets folder.

43
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:53,280
This directory will contain a mixture of JavaScript, Cius and Code.

44
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:56,460
Gutenberg is mostly written with JavaScript.

45
00:02:56,790 --> 00:03:01,980
This is why we're not placing it inside the includes directory as the code will be vastly different.

46
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:08,190
However, a lot of the logic inside these files do affect how WordPress functions rather than the user

47
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:08,960
experience.

48
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:12,900
That is also why we're not placing this inside the assets folder.

49
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:16,110
This is how I prefer to structure my plugin.

50
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:19,470
If you prefer to do something else, then that's completely fine.

51
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:25,710
In the resource section of this lecture, I provide a zip file that contains some starter files, download

52
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:29,850
it and unzip the contents into the blocks folder which just created.

53
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:37,600
This is basically the same setup we had in the previous section with some additional features, let's

54
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:40,980
go through this one by one, open the package file.

55
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:43,240
We're going to start with the dependencies.

56
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:49,570
The first module is the Bable core module, which will allow us to write the latest features of JavaScript

57
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:50,830
right after this.

58
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:55,180
We're loading the Bable plug ins, transform react module.

59
00:03:55,510 --> 00:04:00,730
That's quite a long name, which can make it seem intimidating, but it performs one simple task.

60
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:02,980
It allows you to rename a function.

61
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:07,810
The function it'll change is the react create element function.

62
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:12,460
Previously you learned that this function will create an HTML element.

63
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:17,250
As you can imagine, it's a pretty common function to use no matter what you're building.

64
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:22,210
The problem with this is that react can change how this function works in the future.

65
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:26,050
WordPress prides itself on being backwards compatible.

66
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:30,370
If this function changes, then all plugins will have to update as well.

67
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:35,980
While the most popular plugins will keep up, the lesser used plugins will quickly become outdated.

68
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:42,070
To resolve this, WordPress Wrap's The react create element function with its own function.

69
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:47,980
Even if the react version changes, WordPress will make the adjustments required internally for you.

70
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:53,920
Since that's the case, we want to be able to tell people to use the WordPress version of this function.

71
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:55,870
This is what that plugin does.

72
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:58,780
You'll see how that's configured in just a moment.

73
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:07,450
Then we have the Bable loader module for Web pack right after this is the at WordPress Bable preset

74
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:08,350
default module.

75
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:13,390
This is a new module I'm introducing in the resource section of this lecture.

76
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:15,070
I provide a link to this module.

77
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:19,330
As we discussed before, Bable can be used with various presets.

78
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:23,200
These presets determine what features of JavaScript you can write.

79
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:27,940
It helps people convert your code into code that most browsers can understand.

80
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:32,470
Previously, we use the Bable preset EMV module.

81
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:37,630
However, we're going to need some additional features that aren't available under this module.

82
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:41,580
This will force us to install additional modules and go over them.

83
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:46,780
Luckily, the WordPress development team created their own preset that has us covered.

84
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:49,540
Now we don't have to configure Babille as much.

85
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,550
Let's keep moving forward.

86
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:55,600
Afterwards were loading in a module called Cross Environment.

87
00:05:55,870 --> 00:06:00,280
As you may know, there are various operating systems with their own set of commands.

88
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:04,630
Windows is particularly known to be quite troublesome in this area.

89
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:10,540
The cross environment module will make sure that certain settings and commands will work across all

90
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:11,800
operating systems.

91
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:14,750
It's a great module for keeping things consistent.

92
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:21,820
Lastly, we're loading in the Web pack and pack CLIA modules, which we went over in the previous section.

93
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,820
These dependencies will start us off.

94
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:30,310
There's quite a few more modules I want to introduce, but we'll look at those as the course progresses.

95
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:34,810
Something I want to highlight is that you don't have to be an expert on these modules.

96
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:39,610
All of these modules are configurable, but a lot of the defaults work just fine.

97
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:45,190
If we were building a server, then we might want to configure this further, but we're just building

98
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:45,790
blocks.

99
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:48,970
All that's important is that you have an overview of things.

100
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:51,160
All right, let's keep moving forward.

101
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:56,780
If you look inside the scripts property, you'll find that the commands are slightly different.

102
00:06:57,070 --> 00:07:00,150
First up is the cross dash end of command.

103
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:05,850
This will assure that the commands we execute are cross compatible with multiple operating systems.

104
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:10,600
This is related to the cross environment module we talked about earlier.

105
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:16,690
It's important that the cross dash end of command is entered first so that all the other commands and

106
00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:20,050
options that follow after it will work next.

107
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:23,530
We're setting the Babel environment variable to default.

108
00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:26,920
This will just make sure the default settings are used in Babel.

109
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:31,930
Afterwards, we're calling the Web pat command and setting the watch option.

110
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:33,940
In the previous section.

111
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:38,170
We had to continuously run the commands any time we updated a file.

112
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:43,060
The watch option will force Web pack to continuously watch for changes.

113
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:46,840
This should save us some time that should do it for this file.

114
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:52,780
Let's move onto the web pack dot config JS file at the very top.

115
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:55,930
We're loading the path and web pack modules.

116
00:07:56,290 --> 00:08:01,060
Then we immediately export an object that contains our settings for web pack.

117
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:03,340
A lot of this is the same as before.

118
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:05,890
From the entry to the output properties.

119
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,290
There are three things different here.

120
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:10,480
First is the watch property.

121
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:14,860
This will force Web pack to continuously watch the file for changes.

122
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:18,610
We're already doing this in our command, so this is a bit redundant.

123
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:21,820
I just wanted to show you the two ways of going about this.

124
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,220
It's all preference.

125
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:30,610
Next, we have the dev tool property web pack will take the time to generate source maps for our JavaScript

126
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:31,150
files.

127
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:36,860
The purpose of a source map is to convert compressed and modified code back into its original state.

128
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:41,000
There's very little impact on performance, but build times do increase.

129
00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:47,000
There are various values you can use, but I prefer to use the cheap eval source map.

130
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:51,860
This results in a very fast build time, but the source map isn't that great.

131
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:55,190
That's perfectly fine since we won't be using a source map.

132
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:57,410
We want something fast and cheap.

133
00:08:58,150 --> 00:09:01,380
The last change is in the rules for the Bable loader.

134
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:04,290
I'm adding a new property called Exclude.

135
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:08,810
This will make sure Bable doesn't run any files, any particular directory.

136
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:14,170
In this case, we don't want Bable to process any files inside the node.

137
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:15,940
Underscore Module's directory.

138
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:19,960
We didn't do this before because the previous examples were simple.

139
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:25,710
However, things are going to get a little more complicated from here on out and so I want to make sure

140
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:27,680
of this directory doesn't get affected.

141
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:29,870
That'll do it for this file.

142
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:34,290
The last file I want to go over is the Dot Bable Arcy file.

143
00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:35,980
Not much going on here.

144
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:40,380
I'm just using the WordPress default preset we installed earlier.

145
00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:46,750
We don't have to worry about adding the react preset as the WordPress default preset already covers

146
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:47,450
that for us.

147
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:51,310
The second property we're using here is called plug ins.

148
00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:53,830
Plug ins work exactly as you think.

149
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:57,480
They allow third party modules to extend Bable directly.

150
00:09:57,970 --> 00:10:03,220
All we're doing here is telling people to use the transform react plugin.

151
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:07,510
We're also configuring the plug and bypassing in an additional object.

152
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:15,610
We're setting the pragma property to WP elements, create element that is word précis version of the

153
00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:17,830
react create element of function.

154
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:24,210
We're essentially telling people to use the WP version when transforming elements to JavaScript.

155
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:26,040
That's basically it.

156
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:32,080
Once again, you don't have to be an expert on every module, but it's good to have a general overview

157
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:32,650
of things.

158
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:35,470
The great thing about this is that it's reusable.

159
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:39,460
You can copy this from project to project and things will just work.

160
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:43,090
Now that we have things set up, let's install and check.

161
00:10:43,090 --> 00:10:50,200
If everything works inside your command line, you may need to seed into this directory to run the installation.

162
00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:57,220
I'm going to input seed WP dash content plugins, recipe blocks.

163
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:06,600
Then I'm going to run the commands NPM install to install the modules inside the dependencies object.

164
00:11:06,890 --> 00:11:09,350
This may take a while for some of you, so be patient.

165
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:18,150
Lastly, let's run the commands npm run deve.

166
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:28,770
This should have Westpac processed the code, you shouldn't be able to run any additional commands since

167
00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:35,310
Westpac is continuously watching our files for any changes inside the Blocks directory, there should

168
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:37,950
be a new directory created called DIST.

169
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:44,420
This will contain the bundle JS file that should confirm everything is working as expected.

170
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,230
That does it for this lecture.

171
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,310
We've prepared our environment.

172
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:51,900
The next step is to begin interviewing and registering everything.

173
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,880
We'll do that in the next lecture.

174
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:54,990
I'll see you there.
