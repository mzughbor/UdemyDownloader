00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:13,770
Creating a plugin is very similar to creating a theme, all plug ins can be found inside the WP dash

2
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:15,500
content slash plugins folder.

3
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:21,530
By default, WordPress will provide us with two plug ins, which are the Hello Dolly and a Kismet plug

4
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:21,820
ins.

5
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:24,400
We also see the plug ins we installed earlier.

6
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:26,540
Let's create our own plug in.

7
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:32,860
Unlike themes, plug ins can be created directly inside the plugins folder or in a subfolder.

8
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:39,440
However, it's best practice to just create a subfolder with any plugging the plug and I want to create

9
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,090
is going to be called recipe.

10
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:44,420
I'm going to create a new folder named Recipe.

11
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:48,800
Inside this folder, I'm going to create a new file named Indexed.

12
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:57,140
Just like theme's, you need to provide a file header to tell WordPress that this plugin exists.

13
00:00:57,410 --> 00:01:02,650
Unlike Theme's, though, WordPress doesn't require a certain naming structure for plugins.

14
00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:09,350
Actually, if we take a look at the figure press plugin, then you'll see that all code is in the Fakher

15
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:13,220
Press file and not the indexed file.

16
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:16,540
You can name the main plug and file whatever you want.

17
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:21,080
Some developers name it after they're plugins, others just use indexed.

18
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:23,300
Either one is fine.

19
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,980
I just wanted you to be aware of the two common possibilities.

20
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:29,690
It's all preference for this course.

21
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:33,580
We're going to just keep everything inside the index top file.

22
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:37,820
There's only one requirement to make this an official WordPress plugin.

23
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:41,540
We must create a file header and find one property.

24
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:44,390
So let's create a blog comment.

25
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:49,280
And inside this blog comments add the following plugin name Colen Recipe.

26
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:55,550
That's it, go to your plug ins page and you should now see your plug in appear.

27
00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:59,810
It doesn't have the rest of the information like the other plug ins, but it works.

28
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:04,480
This is the absolute minimum requirement for WordPress to recognize your plug.

29
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:05,630
Nothing else.

30
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:10,639
In the resources section, I provide a link to the file header Codex page.

31
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:14,770
WordPress provides a full list of optional headers we can define.

32
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:16,720
We're going to use a few of these.

33
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:17,770
Let's get started.

34
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:21,770
The second header we want to define is the description.

35
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:28,580
I'm going to put a simple WordPress plugin that allows users to create recipes and rate those recipes.

36
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:37,480
Up next is the version we'll keep it simple by sending it to 1.0.

37
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:44,600
Next is the name of the author, put your name down or the name of your organization.

38
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:51,500
I'm going to put down Udemy, the author, Urai is a link to your personal site or organization site.

39
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,960
I'm going to drop a link to the Udemy site.

40
00:02:56,500 --> 00:03:03,070
Lastly, we want to define the text domain, I know we haven't gone over translations yet, but this

41
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:05,580
should always be set to the name of your plugin folder.

42
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,570
So set this to recipe.

43
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:15,020
Let's refresh the plugin page and see if everything works, you should see something similar to what

44
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:15,420
I see.

45
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:19,690
Feel free to look at the other headers and define whatever suits your needs.
