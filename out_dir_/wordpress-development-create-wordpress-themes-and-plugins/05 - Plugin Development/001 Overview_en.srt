1
00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:10,340
We're going to be jumping into plug in development now.

2
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:15,260
One thing I need to stress is that everything you can do in plug ins can be done in themes and vice

3
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:15,690
versa.

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:19,370
A lot of the functions we use and themes can be used in plug ins.

5
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:22,370
This also applies to hooks and even templates.

6
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:27,770
The reason we're switching to plug ins is because we'll be extending the functionality of WordPress.

7
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:34,580
Unlike our theme, we just modified WordPress for design reasons now will be making changes that go

8
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:35,530
beyond design.

9
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:41,360
You are more than free and allowed to just keep working in your theme, but I highly don't recommend

10
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:41,480
it.

11
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:45,270
As you can tell, I like to keep everything separate and organized.

12
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:48,110
This also applies to plug ins and themes.

13
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:53,280
Code that extends WordPress should be put in a plug in, while themes should be for design.

14
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:57,110
It's perfectly fine to bundle your custom plug ins with your theme.

15
00:00:57,470 --> 00:01:00,920
I will show you how to do that when we reach the end of this course.

16
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:05,980
The plug in I have in mind will allow users to create recipes and submit them.

17
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:13,010
We will also be creating a user registration and login form as well as managing the recipes, this blog,

18
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:17,590
and it will be very advanced and as the course progresses, we'll be switching between our theme and

19
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:17,870
plug.

20
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:22,970
I want to warn you, though, we will begin to discuss more advanced concepts.

21
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:26,750
A lot of what we've done so far has been taken care of by WordPress.

22
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:32,450
We haven't written a single database query, nor did we really have to create our own functions to handle

23
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:34,380
advanced logic or sanitize data.

24
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:39,530
This is the part of the course where we will start digging into the core of WordPress and learn how

25
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:40,070
it works.

26
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:41,170
I hope you're ready.

27
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:43,250
Oh.
