Just in case you have any problems, then you can download the source code for this section here.You can view all the lecture notes here just in case you need them. Please be sure to let me know if you have any questions. Thanks!</p><h4>LectureNotes</h4><p><strong>Overview</strong></p><ul><li><p>Youre more than free to add code to the theme rather than creating a separate plugin, but thats not recommended. You want to keep code that extends WordPress into its own file.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Creating our FirstPlugin</strong></p><ul><li><p>All plugins are stored inside the<strong> wp-content/plugins</strong> folder. WordPress will provide 2 plugins which are the Hello Dolly and Akismet plugins.</p></li><li><p>WordPress will scan the <strong>plugins </strong>directory for files and any subfolder files for file headers.</p></li><li><p>The minimum requirement for WordPress to recognize a plugin is the <strong>Plugin Name</strong> header property.</p></li><li><p>You can name your main plugin files whatever you want. Some plugins will use the <strong>index.php</strong> file and others will use the name of their plugin.</p></li></ul><p><strong>WordPress Action &amp;FilterHooks</strong></p><ul><li><p>Hooks, Actions and Filters are what WordPress calls the Plugins API.</p></li><li><p>Filter hooks/functions are <strong>always </strong>pass in something to filter and are <strong>always </strong>expected to return something. You are allowed to <strong>return false</strong>.</p></li><li><p>Action hooks/functions can do anything behind the scenes. You dont have to output or return anything. You can run an SQL query or send out an email. Anything goes.</p></li></ul><p><strong>CustomHooks andPrioritization</strong></p><ul><li><p>Its perfectly acceptable to use the same hooks several times. To control which functions run first you should set the priority.</p></li><li><p>If you dont set the priority, WordPress will run the functions as 1st come 1st serve. The lower the number the higher priority it gets.</p></li><li><p>Action hooks are triggered using the<strong> do_action() </strong>function. This function accepts the name of the hooks youd like to trigger.</p></li><li><p>Filter hooks are triggered using the <strong>apply_filters() </strong>function which accepts the name of the hook to trigger and the data to filter.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Plugin Activation &amp;Security</strong></p><ul><li><p>Checking if a function or constant is defined is a great way to check if a WordPress is the one loading your files.</p></li><li><p>The<strong> register_activation_hook()</strong> function is a function specifically made for plugins that will trigger when your plugin is activated.</p></li><li><p>Its always good practice to perform checks to make sure the current WordPress site is compatible with your plugin.</p></li><li><p>The<strong> version_compare()</strong> function allows you to compare version schematics that arent possible with traditional comparison operators.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Creating a CustomPost Type</strong></p><ul><li><p>Custom post types allow you to create a custom UI for a specific kind of content.</p></li><li><p>The <strong>init </strong>hook runs when the WordPres begins to initialize the data. This hook runs very early so its the best place to register post types.</p></li><li><p>The <strong>_x() </strong>function allows you to translate strings and also provide a context for the translator. A context allows you to describe how the translated string is being used for a more accurate translation.</p></li><li><p>The <strong>register_post_type() </strong>function will allow you to create a post type. This function requires the name of the post type along with various settings.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Metadata API</strong></p><ul><li><p>The metadata API allows you to attach data to specific content from posts to users. By itself, the data is not useful. Metadata <strong>HAS</strong> to be attached to something.</p></li><li><p>The <strong>update_post_meta()</strong> function will create the metadata if it already doesnt exist.</p></li><li><p>The <strong>save_post</strong> hook is <strong>optionally</strong> dynamic. By appending your custom post type you can make sure the hook is only triggered when your custom post type is create/updated.</p></li><li><p>Its always important to sanitize user input. The <strong>update_post_meta</strong> will already do this for you, but you should still take extra precautions.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Filterhooks</strong></p><ul><li><p>Filter hooks/functions allow you to filter through data and modify the final result. Youre always expected to return data.</p></li><li><p>Whenever you create a post type, WordPress will generate a new permalink structure. You need to flush the rules in order for WordPress to recognize the changes. One way is by updating the permalink structure from the admin dashboard.</p></li><li><p>Separating the HTML from PHP can be a great way to organize your code.</p></li><li><p>I18N means <strong>internationalization</strong>. Its a term for making your code translatable.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Creating Database Tables</strong></p><ul><li><p>WordPress creates about 11 database tables on a fresh installation.</p></li><li><p>You are allowed to create your own database tables if the APIs dont suit your needs.</p></li><li><p>To create a database table youll need the function <strong>dbDelta() </strong>to help you do so.</p></li><li><p>HeidiSQL is a great tool for interacting with your SQL database. It provides a lot of tools and information.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Sending and Using AJAXRequests</strong></p><ul><li><p>WordPress does not provide a AJAX URL variable so you will need to generate one and pass it to your JS files using the <strong>wp_localize_script()</strong> function.</p></li><li><p>All AJAX requests should be sent to the <strong>admin-ajax.php </strong>file inside the <strong>wp-admin</strong> folder.</p></li><li><p>The chrome developer tools provide a way for you to keep track of what files are loaded and how long it took to load those files. It even provides information about each individual file.</p></li><li><p>There are 2 hooks. The <strong>wp_ajax </strong>and <strong>wp_ajax_nopriv </strong>hooks. The <strong>nopriv </strong>version is for users who are not logged in.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Handling AJAXRequests and Inserting data into the Database</strong><br></p><ul><li><p>You can insert data using the <strong>wpdb-&gt;insert()</strong> method. This method will also sanitize all data and generate a proper query for you.</p></li><li><p>There are 3 formats which are string, integer and float. The format for string is <strong>%s</strong>. The format for integer is <strong>%d</strong>. The format for float is <strong>%f</strong>.</p></li><li><p>WordPress provides a few method for executing custom queries. The <strong>get_var() </strong>method will execute a custom query and return a single value from that query.</p></li><li><p>The<strong> AVG()</strong> SQL function will average out all the values from a particular column.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Changing the Custom Post Type's Table Columns</strong></p><ul><li><p>You are allowed to modify the columns outputted on the admin side of WordPress using action/filter hooks.</p></li><li><p>Custom columns must be handled by you. WordPress will take care of its own columns.</p></li></ul>
