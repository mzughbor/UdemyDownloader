00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:14,220
Throughout this course, I've introduced you to various APIs and concepts related to WordPress, everything

2
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:17,620
we've dealt with so far can be put under the word press corps API.

3
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:23,690
The word press corps APIs is the general term for all the APIs WordPress encompasses.

4
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:27,120
First, let's understand what an API is.

5
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:33,840
An API is basically a set of functions, variables and classes provided by a system for you to use to

6
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,180
interact with that system.

7
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:37,890
In our case, WordPress is that system.

8
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,470
We've already been using some of those APIs.

9
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:46,320
When we created our theme and plugin, we didn't have to create many of the queries ourselves or have

10
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,970
to process a lot of the data.

11
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:50,580
A lot of it was taken care of by WordPress.

12
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:53,820
We used a list of functions provided by WordPress.

13
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:57,840
This reduced the time required to develop a theme and plug in.

14
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:05,790
In the resource section, I provided a link to all WordPress APIs available to us, as you can see,

15
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:08,310
WordPress has quite a few APIs.

16
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:12,360
I want to make one very important point about these APIs.

17
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:16,020
All these APIs are available in both plugins and Vimes.

18
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:18,870
So let's say we use the database API.

19
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,130
You can use these functions when you're developing either a plugin or a theme.

20
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:27,090
We won't be able to go over every API in this course.

21
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:29,790
But let me give you a brief overview of each one.

22
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:33,030
We've already talked about most of these APIs already.

23
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:37,500
We've talked about the Dashboard Widgets API and Database API.

24
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:41,490
The file header API is one we haven't talked about yet.

25
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:46,230
This API allows you to read files and search for a file header information.

26
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:51,960
If you can recall, file headers are blocked comments that help WordPress to take plug ins and themes.

27
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:58,080
If we were to open the main plug and file, you'll find the file header we created at the very top.

28
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:02,700
These set of functions are what WordPress uses to read this information.

29
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:07,740
You're more than free to use these functions if you ever need to read file header information.

30
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:09,630
We won't be going over these.

31
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:14,340
But it's always nice to know that WordPress allows you to use the same functions it uses.

32
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:17,820
The next API is the File System API.

33
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:19,230
This is an API.

34
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:20,760
We haven't gone over either.

35
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,330
This API is what WordPress uses to update itself.

36
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:30,750
Traditionally, to transfer files, you would create a form with an upload input and process the files

37
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:31,680
after submission.

38
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:38,250
However, this API goes beyond that by allowing you to securely connect with an external server and

39
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:42,090
securely transfer files between your server and the external server.

40
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:47,250
We won't be going over how this works because it's very uncommon to use this API.

41
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:52,650
However, you're more than free to read up on this API to learn more after you're finished with this

42
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:53,130
course.

43
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,530
Let's keep going down the list.

44
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:59,760
We've already gone over the API and metadata API.

45
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:06,510
The options API is what we'll be covering in the next few lectures as well as the Settings API, so

46
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:08,280
I'll skip going over those for now.

47
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:14,130
The plugin API is the hooks, actions and filters we discussed quite some time ago.

48
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:20,700
The Quick Tags API allows you to add buttons to the editor, but we won't be using it as there are other

49
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,470
and better ways to accomplish this.

50
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:23,940
It's also outdated.

51
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:25,650
With the introduction of Gutenberg.

52
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:30,300
We've also gone over the Rewrite API and Shortcode API.

53
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:36,480
You'll notice there are two APIs here which are the modification API and Customization API.

54
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:41,130
The customization API is specifically for the WordPress customizer.

55
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:46,890
The modification API is for theme modification settings which are saved in the database.

56
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:53,940
These two APIs are connected together, but despite that, WordPress addresses that the two can be separated.

57
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:58,710
You don't have to use Customizer API to use the modifications API.

58
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:02,100
You can add and remove modifications wherever you want.

59
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:06,330
The next APIs are the Transients and Widgets API.

60
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:08,880
We've already discussed how to use these.

61
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:13,050
The very last API is XML, AAPC, WordPress API.

62
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:16,050
This API is a very special case use.

63
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:22,170
It gives developers who make mobile apps, desktop apps and other services the ability to talk to your

64
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:22,920
WordPress site.

65
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:28,590
WordPress provides developers a way to write applications that can do many of the things that you can

66
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:31,190
do when launched into WordPress via the Web interface.

67
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:39,600
These tasks include publish a post, edit a post, delete a post, upload a new file, get a list of

68
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,580
comments, edit comments.

69
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:47,130
We won't be going over this API as this kind of stuff goes beyond the scope of this course.

70
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,040
That pretty much sums up all the APIs.

71
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:55,530
In the next few lectures, we'll work on improving the recipe plugin before we get into the more advanced

72
00:04:55,530 --> 00:04:56,190
topics.
