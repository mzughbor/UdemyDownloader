1
00:00:07,939 --> 00:00:13,520
A problem has appeared that really isn't visible at first glance, if you take a look at the ED, you'll

2
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:16,010
see this button called ad media right above it.

3
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:19,990
This allows you to use the media uploader inside the text editor.

4
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:23,490
It's really useful, but not completely usable for everyone.

5
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:28,790
I want you to log out and then sign in as the test user we created earlier.

6
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:34,490
If you don't remember those credentials, then just create another account and try submitting a recipe.

7
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:43,420
You'll notice that the button we had previously is gone long out and logged back in as an admin.

8
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:46,520
So what exactly is going on?

9
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:51,410
Well, first, let's check out that capability's versus rules table.

10
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:56,480
First in the resource section of this lecture, I provide a link to this page and table.

11
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:58,460
I've shown you this table before.

12
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:01,460
It lists all the roles and their capabilities.

13
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:05,510
By default, all new users are assigned to the subscriber role.

14
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:11,160
Unless you manually set it, scroll to the very bottom of the table and you'll see that the subscriber

15
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:13,850
roll only has one capability which is read.

16
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:19,270
In order to see the ad media button, you need the capability upload files.

17
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:22,280
This is a very important concept to understand.

18
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:26,360
WordPress doesn't care very much about what role a user is in.

19
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:28,910
It cares more about their capabilities.

20
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:33,440
WordPress, plug ins and themes will check your capability over your role.

21
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:36,820
All the old does is group your capabilities together.

22
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:42,680
If you scroll down this page even further, you'll find the default capabilities described in detail

23
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,170
and what you can do with each one.

24
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:50,270
With that being said, we have to decide on a way where the user can have the capability upload files.

25
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:56,930
The first solution that comes to mind is just to make it so all users who register are assigned to the

26
00:01:56,930 --> 00:01:57,600
author role.

27
00:01:58,070 --> 00:02:03,260
However, this would also assign them other capabilities we may not want users to have.

28
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:09,100
Another solution is to modify the subscriber role and just add the upload files capability.

29
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:13,720
The problem with this is that we shouldn't try to modify default WordPress roles.

30
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:18,990
The last solution is to just create our own custom role with custom capabilities.

31
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:24,830
This is the best solution and it's quite simple to implement open the plug in activation file.

32
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:33,450
At the very end of the function, I'm going to grab the WP Rolls Global Variable, this variable contains

33
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:36,030
information about the current roles and WordPress.

34
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:37,140
We need this.

35
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:43,140
If we're going to add our very own role with capabilities to add a role, we need to call the function

36
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:43,830
add role.

37
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,990
This function has three parameters.

38
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,140
The first parameter is the role name.

39
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:51,260
This can be thought of as an ID for the role.

40
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:53,970
I'm going to set this to recipe author.

41
00:02:56,370 --> 00:03:02,190
The second parameter is a readable name of the role, I'm going to make this translatable and set this

42
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:03,480
to recipe author.

43
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:11,560
The last parameter is a list of capabilities this role will have, there are three roles they want to

44
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,060
assign.

45
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:17,380
I want to set the read and it posts and upload files capabilities to true.

46
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:25,920
All these capabilities will now be grouped together with this role.

47
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:27,560
That's all you need to do.

48
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:30,940
I want you to deactivate and reactivate this plugin.

49
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:32,810
You shouldn't receive any errors.

50
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:42,090
Now, all we have to do is tell WordPress that all new registered users should be assigned this role.

51
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:46,560
Luckily, you don't have to write a single line of code to accomplish this.

52
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:48,710
Go to settings, General.

53
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:55,250
If you look at the new user default rule setting, you'll notice that the recipe author appearing as

54
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:55,780
an option.

55
00:03:56,090 --> 00:03:59,210
I want you to select this role and then save your changes.

56
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:08,570
To save some time, I'm not going to create a new user, I'm just going to modify the test user and

57
00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:11,690
change their role to the newly created role and save.

58
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:20,980
Then I'm going to log out and log in as the test user again, try submitting a recipe.

59
00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:30,410
You should see the ad media button up here for the user.

60
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:32,370
This is exactly what we wanted.

61
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:34,310
We can now proceed as normal.
