<p>Congratulations on making it this far! Just in case you have any problems, then you can download the source code for this section here.You can view all the lecture notes here just in case you need them. Please be sure to let me know if you have any questions. Thanks!</p><h4>LectureNotes</h4><p><strong>WordPressAPIs</strong></p><ul><li>WordPress provides many APIs out of the box. APIs allow you to interact with WordPress easily without having to write a lot of the logic and queries yourself.</li><li>Youve already learned how to use most of the APIs throughout this course. There are some APIs we wont be going over as they arent commonly used.</li></ul><p><strong>Options API</strong></p><ul><li>The options API allows you to store settings and options for your theme/plugin. WordPress use this API for its own settings.</li><li>Its perfectly fine to create your own table as we did in the previous lecture. However, the APIs are meant to keep the database fairily minimal and easy to manage. So consider using an API before creating a table.</li><li>Make sure to check if certain options exist before creating it.</li></ul><p><strong>Adding an Admin Menu and Page</strong></p><ul><li>The hook to add an admin menu is the <strong>admin_menu </strong>hook. Its important you do not run this hook inside a function using the <strong>admin_init </strong>hook.</li><li>Capabilities determine what a user can or cant do. Roles are a way to group capabilities together. Its important that you check a users capabilities rather than a role as capabilities can be changed within a role.</li><li>WordPress provides a class called <strong>wrap </strong>which helps positon the content of your admin page.</li></ul><p><strong>Processing Admin Form Settings</strong></p><ul><li>The <strong>admin_post_ </strong>is a dynamic hook. The name of the action from a request will be appended to the hook to determine what function will run.</li><li>Its always good practice to check the capability of a user before executing any more code. You can check a users capability by using the function <strong>current_user_can().</strong></li><li>You can redirect a user using the <strong>wp_redirect()</strong> function which accepts a URL.</li></ul><p><strong>Settings API</strong></p><ul><li>The settings API will generate a form, process that form, and update your options for you. Its the preferred solution for developers who prefer to use pure PHP.</li><li>The settings API is completely optional to use. You are more than free and allowed to create your own UI and process your own data. There is no wrong or right answer here.</li><li>The settings API has about 3 layers. The first layer is the page. The second layer would be the sections related to a page. The third layer would be the input fields for a section.</li></ul><p><strong>Featured Images using the WordPress Media Uploader</strong></p><ul><li>WordPress provides an object called <strong>wp </strong>which provides a set of methods and properties for interacting with WordPress with JavaScript.</li><li>The WordPress media uploader will handle uploading images while also providing a simple UI for browsing and selecting an image.</li><li>To associate an image with a post you need to use a function called <strong>set_post_thumbnail()</strong>.</li></ul><p><strong>Custom User Roles and Capabilities</strong></p><ul><li>Roles are a way to group capabilities for a user. A capability determines what a user can or cant do.</li><li>Creating a role is very simple. You just call the <strong>add_role()</strong> function and pass in an array of capabilities youd like a user to have.</li><li>To set the default role you need to go to the admin dashboard and navigate to <strong>Settings &gt; General</strong>. From there you can set the default role for new users.</li></ul><p><strong>Custom Taxonomies</strong></p><ul><li>Taxonomies are a way to associate words or phrases with a single post.</li><li>Each individual word or phrase is what WordPress calls a term.</li><li>Taxonomies are a very simple concept, but theyre very complex in design.</li></ul><p><strong>Custom Taxonomy Settings</strong></p><ul><li>Taxonomies can have meta data and be extended. There are 2 forms you need to account for which are the add and edit forms.</li><li>The <strong>wp_get_post_terms() </strong>function will get the terms for a particular post and taxonomy.</li></ul><p><strong>Custom Post Type UIand AdvancedCustom Fields</strong></p><ul><li>The custom post type UI plugin will help you with generating custom post types and taxonomies without having to write a single line of code.</li><li>The ACF (Advanced Custom Fields) plugin will help you generate custom fields for certain post types. It can even create fields that arent normally possible with plain HTML.</li><li>Youre not limited to one option or the other. You can combine your knowledge with these plugins to rapidly build plugins/themes. These plugins use the same APIs and functions you would use.</li></ul>
