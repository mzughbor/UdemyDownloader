00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:12,270
Throughout this course, we've talked about quite a few important concepts for WordPress development,

2
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:17,940
a lot of the problems we've been facing can be solved by using to plug ins called custom post tight

3
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:20,490
UI and advanced custom fields.

4
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:25,750
These two plug ins will create post types, taxonomies and custom fields for us.

5
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:32,490
Let's check these plug ins out inside the admin dashboard, navigate to plug ins, add new search for

6
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:32,940
the plug in.

7
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:34,930
It called custom post type UI.

8
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:38,190
This plug in was created by Web Dev Studios.

9
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:40,350
Install and activate this plug in.

10
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:51,000
After activating this plugin, you should find a menu called CPT UI appear, let's create a new post

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:51,280
type.

12
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:56,940
There are a lot of fields here, but each field corresponds to a setting we can set in the register

13
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:58,040
post type function.

14
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:04,310
Not only that, but there are also these little helper texts that describe what each setting does.

15
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:10,460
As you can see, this plugin is extremely powerful and easy to use, even for people who can't code.

16
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:12,650
Let's create a new post type.

17
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:14,770
The first three fields are required.

18
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:18,420
I'm going to set the post type slug to music.

19
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:21,990
The plural and singular labels will be music.

20
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:29,990
Right after this, you can set additional labels, but I'm going to leave this as is, I'm going to

21
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:33,670
toggle this for a second so that we don't have to scroll all the way down.

22
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:36,380
Then we have some settings we can set.

23
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,530
Most of these are fine by default.

24
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:43,460
If you scroll down, you'll find a list of taxonomies we can assign to this post type.

25
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:47,450
We even see the origin taxonomy we created earlier.

26
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:51,200
I want to create a custom taxonomy for this post type.

27
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:52,700
We'll do that next.

28
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:55,190
Before we do, let's add this post type.

29
00:01:57,890 --> 00:02:03,740
Once added, you can view the post site by clicking on The View post type's tab, the plugin provides

30
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:09,500
plenty of information about this post type edit settings and even provides information about how you

31
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:12,080
would use this post type in the template hierarchy.

32
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:14,100
This is incredibly useful.

33
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:19,340
Let's create the taxonomy genre that will be associated with this post type.

34
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:24,040
This plugin allows you to create taxonomies without having to write code.

35
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:29,240
You can create it by going to see UI add edit taxonomies.

36
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:32,120
Let's create a taxonomy for genres.

37
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:37,370
The slug will be genre, the plural will be genres and the singular will be genre.

38
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:46,060
Nothing too crazy, we even have the opportunity to assign this taxonomy to a post type, I only want

39
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:49,070
this taxonomy to apply to the music post type.

40
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:52,130
So check that box only just like last time.

41
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:55,010
You can also set some additional labels and settings.

42
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:57,820
I'm fine with most of these settings except for one.

43
00:02:58,150 --> 00:03:02,740
The show in reste settings should be set to true just like last time.

44
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:05,560
Custom taxonomies can only work in Gothenburg.

45
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,810
If this value is true.

46
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:08,050
Submit the form.

47
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,910
You should see a success message.

48
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:16,840
If you look at the menu, you'll find our music post type and under the men you'll find the genre taxonomy.

49
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:21,970
If you were to create a new music post, you'll find a new panel for the genre.

50
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:25,900
We didn't have to write a single line of code to accomplish any of this.

51
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,970
Let's keep going with this route.

52
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:30,430
I want to create some custom fields.

53
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:37,120
Unfortunately, it's not possible with the custom post type UI plugin, go to plugins, add new and

54
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,690
search for the plugin Advanced Custom Fields by Elliott Condon.

55
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:42,820
Install and activate this plugin.

56
00:03:49,490 --> 00:03:55,370
On the menu, you'll find a new item called Custom Fields, click on it and you'll see an overview of

57
00:03:55,370 --> 00:03:57,830
all the custom fields created with this plug in.

58
00:03:58,190 --> 00:03:58,810
It's empty.

59
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:00,890
So let's add in two new fields.

60
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:06,250
Click on the add field buttons and you'll be taken to this page where you can create some fields.

61
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:11,360
I'm going to call this group Music Options, then I'm going to add one field.

62
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:16,040
The first field will be called release date.

63
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:24,320
Immediately after typing this, Akef will automatically generate the next field that's fine with me,

64
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:29,450
as that would be the name I would have used originally for the field type, I'm going to set this to

65
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:30,290
date picture.

66
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,510
The rest of the settings are fine, as is.

67
00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:33,950
That's about it.

68
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:36,110
I'm going to publish these changes.

69
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:40,240
You should receive a success message.

70
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,080
Let's try creating a new music post.

71
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:54,670
All the way at the bottom, you should see the field appearing, the release date even has this fancy

72
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:55,350
date picture.

73
00:04:55,690 --> 00:05:00,400
I'm going to fill in some stuff here, make sure to publish your post after doing so.

74
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:11,180
If you look at the post, it'll look all right, but we get this error and it's loading information

75
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:16,910
we're not interested in to fix this, we're going to create a template specific to this post type,

76
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:24,830
create a file named single dash music, copy everything from the single template into this template.

77
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:30,470
I'm going to remove the comments and related posts section.

78
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:41,450
Then I'm going to add some code right above the content function.

79
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:49,760
In order to get fields from the advanced custom fields, you're provided a function called the field

80
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:52,500
you pass in the name of the field you'd like to grab.

81
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:55,310
I'm going to grab the release date.

82
00:05:57,230 --> 00:06:02,040
Refresh the page after you've made these changes, and you should see the template working accordingly.

83
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:04,640
This is the power of these two plugins.

84
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:08,280
They're really popular with over a million installations combined.

85
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:11,960
So why don't I show you how to do all of this manually?

86
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:17,780
Well, it's important to understand how WordPress works and how these plugins work behind the scenes.

87
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:22,140
These plug ins are doing the exact same thing we did in the previous lectures.

88
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:27,230
They're calling the register taxonomy function and using metadata just like we were.

89
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:33,110
The only difference is that these plugins take it a step further by simply automating the process for

90
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:33,310
you.

91
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:36,200
In my opinion, these plug ins are really great.

92
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:39,000
They make developing sites a whole lot faster.

93
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:41,990
I recommend you give them a try and learn more about them.

94
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:48,410
Of course, they can't handle all situations for you, but they should be able to solve most, if not

95
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:49,850
half of your problems for you.

96
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:53,120
You're not limited to just using one or the other.

97
00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:58,160
You can use these plug ins to create post types, taxonomies and custom fields for you.

98
00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:00,140
Then you can add in your own code.

99
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:05,780
If you need more functionality, you use the exact same functions as you would before without any worry

100
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:06,360
or hassle.

101
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:09,020
This is the beauty of WordPress development.

102
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:15,230
Even though every plugin does different things, they all use the same APIs and functions as you would

103
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:16,340
before.

104
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:20,840
And this lecture, there was one more resource I want to show you that will help me with some of the

105
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:23,570
problems you'll face in the field of WordPress development.

106
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:29,230
In the resource section of this lecture, I provide a link to the Generate WP site.

107
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:31,640
This site will help generate code.

108
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:35,750
You need to create things like taxonomies, post types and so much more.

109
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:37,880
Let's explore one of these tools.

110
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:41,420
I'm going to click on the post type generator page.

111
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:45,710
This generator will generate the exact code you need to create a post type.

112
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:49,670
You can even modify these settings with a user friendly interface.

113
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:55,370
I'm going to change the post type feel to music, then I'm going to click update code.

114
00:07:55,700 --> 00:08:00,200
The code will then refresh and you will now see our changes reflected on the code.

115
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,530
This tool is invaluable and is extremely flexible.

116
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:08,780
If you're not comfortable with using a plugin to generate your post types and would rather write your

117
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:14,810
own code than this tool and site will make that process easier, I highly recommend you bookmark it.

118
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:18,770
It has several tools you can use related to WordPress development.

119
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:20,450
That's basically it.

120
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:23,870
And the next few lectures will be getting into some advanced topics.

121
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:25,940
So get ready to do some more coding.
