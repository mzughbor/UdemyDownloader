00:07.650 --> 00:12.270
Throughout this course, we've talked about quite a few important concepts for WordPress development,

00:12.540 --> 00:17.940
a lot of the problems we've been facing can be solved by using to plug ins called custom post tight

00:17.940 --> 00:20.490
UI and advanced custom fields.

00:21.090 --> 00:25.750
These two plug ins will create post types, taxonomies and custom fields for us.

00:26.190 --> 00:32.490
Let's check these plug ins out inside the admin dashboard, navigate to plug ins, add new search for

00:32.490 --> 00:32.940
the plug in.

00:32.940 --> 00:34.930
It called custom post type UI.

00:35.400 --> 00:38.190
This plug in was created by Web Dev Studios.

00:38.370 --> 00:40.350
Install and activate this plug in.

00:44.250 --> 00:51.000
After activating this plugin, you should find a menu called CPT UI appear, let's create a new post

00:51.000 --> 00:51.280
type.

00:51.540 --> 00:56.940
There are a lot of fields here, but each field corresponds to a setting we can set in the register

00:56.940 --> 00:58.040
post type function.

00:58.410 --> 01:04.310
Not only that, but there are also these little helper texts that describe what each setting does.

01:04.800 --> 01:10.460
As you can see, this plugin is extremely powerful and easy to use, even for people who can't code.

01:10.890 --> 01:12.650
Let's create a new post type.

01:13.020 --> 01:14.770
The first three fields are required.

01:15.030 --> 01:18.420
I'm going to set the post type slug to music.

01:18.660 --> 01:21.990
The plural and singular labels will be music.

01:24.440 --> 01:29.990
Right after this, you can set additional labels, but I'm going to leave this as is, I'm going to

01:29.990 --> 01:33.670
toggle this for a second so that we don't have to scroll all the way down.

01:34.460 --> 01:36.380
Then we have some settings we can set.

01:36.680 --> 01:38.530
Most of these are fine by default.

01:38.810 --> 01:43.460
If you scroll down, you'll find a list of taxonomies we can assign to this post type.

01:43.910 --> 01:47.450
We even see the origin taxonomy we created earlier.

01:47.730 --> 01:51.200
I want to create a custom taxonomy for this post type.

01:51.530 --> 01:52.700
We'll do that next.

01:52.760 --> 01:55.190
Before we do, let's add this post type.

01:57.890 --> 02:03.740
Once added, you can view the post site by clicking on The View post type's tab, the plugin provides

02:03.740 --> 02:09.500
plenty of information about this post type edit settings and even provides information about how you

02:09.500 --> 02:12.080
would use this post type in the template hierarchy.

02:12.530 --> 02:14.100
This is incredibly useful.

02:14.810 --> 02:19.340
Let's create the taxonomy genre that will be associated with this post type.

02:19.820 --> 02:24.040
This plugin allows you to create taxonomies without having to write code.

02:24.440 --> 02:29.240
You can create it by going to see UI add edit taxonomies.

02:29.750 --> 02:32.120
Let's create a taxonomy for genres.

02:32.330 --> 02:37.370
The slug will be genre, the plural will be genres and the singular will be genre.

02:39.670 --> 02:46.060
Nothing too crazy, we even have the opportunity to assign this taxonomy to a post type, I only want

02:46.060 --> 02:49.070
this taxonomy to apply to the music post type.

02:49.090 --> 02:52.130
So check that box only just like last time.

02:52.150 --> 02:55.010
You can also set some additional labels and settings.

02:55.270 --> 02:57.820
I'm fine with most of these settings except for one.

02:58.150 --> 03:02.740
The show in reste settings should be set to true just like last time.

03:02.950 --> 03:05.560
Custom taxonomies can only work in Gothenburg.

03:05.560 --> 03:06.810
If this value is true.

03:07.150 --> 03:08.050
Submit the form.

03:08.200 --> 03:09.910
You should see a success message.

03:10.420 --> 03:16.840
If you look at the menu, you'll find our music post type and under the men you'll find the genre taxonomy.

03:17.140 --> 03:21.970
If you were to create a new music post, you'll find a new panel for the genre.

03:22.360 --> 03:25.900
We didn't have to write a single line of code to accomplish any of this.

03:26.500 --> 03:27.970
Let's keep going with this route.

03:28.210 --> 03:30.430
I want to create some custom fields.

03:30.640 --> 03:37.120
Unfortunately, it's not possible with the custom post type UI plugin, go to plugins, add new and

03:37.120 --> 03:40.690
search for the plugin Advanced Custom Fields by Elliott Condon.

03:41.050 --> 03:42.820
Install and activate this plugin.

03:49.490 --> 03:55.370
On the menu, you'll find a new item called Custom Fields, click on it and you'll see an overview of

03:55.370 --> 03:57.830
all the custom fields created with this plug in.

03:58.190 --> 03:58.810
It's empty.

03:58.820 --> 04:00.890
So let's add in two new fields.

04:01.100 --> 04:06.250
Click on the add field buttons and you'll be taken to this page where you can create some fields.

04:06.560 --> 04:11.360
I'm going to call this group Music Options, then I'm going to add one field.

04:13.970 --> 04:16.040
The first field will be called release date.

04:18.410 --> 04:24.320
Immediately after typing this, Akef will automatically generate the next field that's fine with me,

04:24.320 --> 04:29.450
as that would be the name I would have used originally for the field type, I'm going to set this to

04:29.450 --> 04:30.290
date picture.

04:30.320 --> 04:32.510
The rest of the settings are fine, as is.

04:33.170 --> 04:33.950
That's about it.

04:34.100 --> 04:36.110
I'm going to publish these changes.

04:38.250 --> 04:40.240
You should receive a success message.

04:40.800 --> 04:43.080
Let's try creating a new music post.

04:49.450 --> 04:54.670
All the way at the bottom, you should see the field appearing, the release date even has this fancy

04:54.670 --> 04:55.350
date picture.

04:55.690 --> 05:00.400
I'm going to fill in some stuff here, make sure to publish your post after doing so.

05:06.320 --> 05:11.180
If you look at the post, it'll look all right, but we get this error and it's loading information

05:11.180 --> 05:16.910
we're not interested in to fix this, we're going to create a template specific to this post type,

05:17.270 --> 05:24.830
create a file named single dash music, copy everything from the single template into this template.

05:27.200 --> 05:30.470
I'm going to remove the comments and related posts section.

05:37.730 --> 05:41.450
Then I'm going to add some code right above the content function.

05:44.540 --> 05:49.760
In order to get fields from the advanced custom fields, you're provided a function called the field

05:50.090 --> 05:52.500
you pass in the name of the field you'd like to grab.

05:53.060 --> 05:55.310
I'm going to grab the release date.

05:57.230 --> 06:02.040
Refresh the page after you've made these changes, and you should see the template working accordingly.

06:02.360 --> 06:04.640
This is the power of these two plugins.

06:04.880 --> 06:08.280
They're really popular with over a million installations combined.

06:08.840 --> 06:11.960
So why don't I show you how to do all of this manually?

06:12.230 --> 06:17.780
Well, it's important to understand how WordPress works and how these plugins work behind the scenes.

06:18.140 --> 06:22.140
These plug ins are doing the exact same thing we did in the previous lectures.

06:22.510 --> 06:27.230
They're calling the register taxonomy function and using metadata just like we were.

06:27.950 --> 06:33.110
The only difference is that these plugins take it a step further by simply automating the process for

06:33.110 --> 06:33.310
you.

06:33.650 --> 06:36.200
In my opinion, these plug ins are really great.

06:36.500 --> 06:39.000
They make developing sites a whole lot faster.

06:39.230 --> 06:41.990
I recommend you give them a try and learn more about them.

06:42.560 --> 06:48.410
Of course, they can't handle all situations for you, but they should be able to solve most, if not

06:48.410 --> 06:49.850
half of your problems for you.

06:50.210 --> 06:53.120
You're not limited to just using one or the other.

06:53.450 --> 06:58.160
You can use these plug ins to create post types, taxonomies and custom fields for you.

06:58.550 --> 07:00.140
Then you can add in your own code.

07:00.140 --> 07:05.780
If you need more functionality, you use the exact same functions as you would before without any worry

07:05.780 --> 07:06.360
or hassle.

07:06.770 --> 07:09.020
This is the beauty of WordPress development.

07:09.470 --> 07:15.230
Even though every plugin does different things, they all use the same APIs and functions as you would

07:15.830 --> 07:16.340
before.

07:16.340 --> 07:20.840
And this lecture, there was one more resource I want to show you that will help me with some of the

07:20.840 --> 07:23.570
problems you'll face in the field of WordPress development.

07:23.930 --> 07:29.230
In the resource section of this lecture, I provide a link to the Generate WP site.

07:29.900 --> 07:31.640
This site will help generate code.

07:31.640 --> 07:35.750
You need to create things like taxonomies, post types and so much more.

07:36.110 --> 07:37.880
Let's explore one of these tools.

07:38.090 --> 07:41.420
I'm going to click on the post type generator page.

07:41.720 --> 07:45.710
This generator will generate the exact code you need to create a post type.

07:46.370 --> 07:49.670
You can even modify these settings with a user friendly interface.

07:49.880 --> 07:55.370
I'm going to change the post type feel to music, then I'm going to click update code.

07:55.700 --> 08:00.200
The code will then refresh and you will now see our changes reflected on the code.

08:00.560 --> 08:03.530
This tool is invaluable and is extremely flexible.

08:04.100 --> 08:08.780
If you're not comfortable with using a plugin to generate your post types and would rather write your

08:08.780 --> 08:14.810
own code than this tool and site will make that process easier, I highly recommend you bookmark it.

08:15.050 --> 08:18.770
It has several tools you can use related to WordPress development.

08:19.340 --> 08:20.450
That's basically it.

08:20.690 --> 08:23.870
And the next few lectures will be getting into some advanced topics.

08:23.870 --> 08:25.940
So get ready to do some more coding.
