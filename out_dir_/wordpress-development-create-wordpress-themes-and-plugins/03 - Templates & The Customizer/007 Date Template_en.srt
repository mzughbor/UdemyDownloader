1
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:12,960
The next template we're going to work on is the dates template, the date template is used to display

2
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:19,500
posts if a user is viewing an archive for a particular date, year, month or day, the order that's

3
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:22,920
used here is date P, then archived.

4
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:31,050
And lastly, indexed WordPress provides functionality for checking if a post is from a certain year,

5
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:34,860
month or day, but doesn't utilize that in their template system.

6
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:38,150
This actually gives us more trouble than it does help.

7
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:44,250
It would be great if we could create templates for certain time frames, but that's just not possible

8
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:45,080
with WordPress.

9
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:48,870
Instead, we will have to perform those checks in our templates.

10
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:51,500
You'll see why this is a problem in just a moment.

11
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:59,860
If you haven't already drag and drop the archives widget onto your sidebar, this will provide some

12
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:02,430
links to viewer posts for particular dates.

13
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:04,739
It will help us a lot later in this lecture.

14
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:10,060
Once you have that set up, let's create the Daytop template file.

15
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:16,600
The date template is an archive template so we can just use the category template as a base.

16
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:24,900
When it comes to date templates, we can't use the archive description function as you can't assign

17
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:31,230
descriptions for dates, and these cases will have to create our own custom descriptions or just remove

18
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:31,900
it entirely.

19
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:35,430
It's up to you and what works best for your theme or design?

20
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:39,150
I'm going to use something called a conditional tag.

21
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:43,860
Conditional tags are just a fancy phrase for functions that perform checks for you.

22
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:48,150
They're similar to template tags, except they're meant to be used inside.

23
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:52,830
Conditional statements will be exploring more conditional tags later in this course.

24
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:54,560
But let's keep it simple for now.

25
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:58,290
I'm going to update this description and add in some code.

26
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:06,270
All right, I'm back and add in a series of conditional statements, it's nothing really complex inside

27
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:07,500
these conditional statements.

28
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,180
I'm using a conditional tag.

29
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:15,390
Each of these functions will check if the date being displayed is for a particular year, month or day.

30
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:20,760
Depending on the date that's being displayed, an appropriate message will be outputted.

31
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:24,960
With that all set, let's check out an archive on the sidebar.

32
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:28,170
You should have this archive widget that displays dates.

33
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,070
Click on any of these and you should now see our template working.

34
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:39,000
Once again, WordPress was able to read the euro and determine what kind of posts to grab from the database.

35
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:41,640
It also took care of generating the title.

36
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:45,510
The only thing we did was taking care of generating the description.

37
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:49,670
Now, let's look at the problems that arise with this template.

38
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:55,890
If you look at the URL, you should see the date it's formatted as year, month and then the day.

39
00:02:56,370 --> 00:03:01,530
If I wanted to see post on a specific date, then I could pass in a day like so.

40
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:05,540
The only requirement for displaying a date archive is the year.

41
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:07,860
So I can remove the month and day like.

42
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:13,020
So something you should know about the date archive is that it will only display if there's at least

43
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:14,690
one post for the date range.

44
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:20,790
For example, if I were to change the year to twenty twenty and refresh the page, then you should see

45
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:24,340
no post the date template doesn't even get loaded.

46
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:26,850
Instead we get the 404 template.

47
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:33,210
Even though it isn't documented inside the template hierarchy, WordPress will fall back to the 404

48
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:35,940
template if there are no posts for a date range.

49
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:41,820
This is a problem because what if we wanted to display a message telling the user there are no posts

50
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:42,390
for a date?

51
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:44,010
We can't do that.

52
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:48,270
We can't even use conditional tags as they will return false.

53
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:52,410
Luckily, the date template isn't a commonly used template.

54
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:58,820
I actually don't find myself creating it or even using it that often, despite the quirks it gives off,

55
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:00,540
they aren't that dangerous or bad.

56
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:03,840
So you can get away with not creating this template.

57
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:06,900
It's definitely a case by case scenario, though.
