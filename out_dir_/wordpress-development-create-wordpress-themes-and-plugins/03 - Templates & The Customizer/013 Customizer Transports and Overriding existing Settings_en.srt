00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:13,090
So far, we've talked about adding settings to the customizer, but what if we wanted to make some changes

2
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:16,900
to the default customizer that's completely possible and allowed.

3
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:21,640
If you believe you know a better way, the customizer should be displayed for your theme, then you're

4
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:23,060
completely allowed to do that.

5
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:25,660
Let's explore some ways to customize this.

6
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:31,570
The first thing I want to do is group my sections into something called panels, panels or a way to

7
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:32,500
group sections.

8
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:38,170
If the theme customizer had a hierarchy, it would be panels, sections, comptrollers.

9
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:40,570
Creating a panel is pretty straightforward.

10
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:47,140
Inside the main customizer file, I'm going to call the ad panel method.

11
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:54,750
I'm calling this method inside this function instead of a separate file, because it encompasses everything,

12
00:00:55,090 --> 00:00:58,060
however, you're free to organize this however you like.

13
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:02,530
This method has two parameters, which is the idea and an array of settings.

14
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:04,900
I'm going to set the ID to you to meet.

15
00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:12,580
The array will have three keys, the first key is the title, which should be human readable.

16
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:15,940
I'm going to set this to you, to me and make it translatable.

17
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:23,830
The next key is description, which will be Udemy themed settings, it's important that you add some

18
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:26,230
P tags as it'll format it properly.

19
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:34,370
The last key is priority, which will determine the location, the higher the number, the lower placement

20
00:01:34,370 --> 00:01:34,910
it gets.

21
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:37,100
I'm going to set this to 160.

22
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:46,350
This will add a panel to the customizer now we can add the sections to this panel to add a section to

23
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:52,950
a panel, you have to specify it inside the ad section method, open both customizer files for the social

24
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:59,370
and miscellaneous settings, look for the ad section method calls and add a new key called panel and

25
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:01,680
pass it in the panel ID, we said earlier.

26
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:12,630
Refresh the page and you should now see the panel udemy, and if you click on it, you'll find both

27
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:14,920
sections appearing under it, which is what we wanted.

28
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:19,590
Now let's talk about customizing existing controllers and sections.

29
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:22,300
There is this section called Site Identity.

30
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:25,440
Let's say I wanted to change the title to General.

31
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,760
To do that, you need to grab the section or controller and modify IT settings.

32
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:36,840
Before we can do that, we have to know the ID of what we want to grab inside the main customized file.

33
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:40,590
I'm going to vade, dump everything and format it with pre-tax.

34
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:51,840
Refresh the page and you should see this huge object outputted, you'll find a lot of information related

35
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:57,000
to the customizer, including all the sections, controllers and panels I'm going to skip to.

36
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,910
These sections are right here.

37
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,960
You'll find all the sections to find.

38
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:06,900
So far as you can see, you'll find all the keys similar to the ones you can set when using the ADD

39
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:07,660
section method.

40
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:13,060
I'm going to look for the section with the title site Identity after finding it.

41
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:18,230
I now see the ID is titled Tag Line Back inside the customizer file.

42
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:20,520
I'm going to call the get section method.

43
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:31,250
This method will grab a section and all its settings you have to pass in the ID, which would be title

44
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:36,920
tag line, as we saw earlier from here, I can then modify any property I want.

45
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:41,890
Previously, when using the ad section method, we use an array for the settings.

46
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:47,510
However, after a section is added, the settings will be converted into an object with properties and

47
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:48,020
methods.

48
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:52,490
Because of that, we have to change the settings as if they were properties.

49
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:55,690
Despite the conversion, the names are usually the same.

50
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:59,450
In this case, we can set the title to General like so.

51
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:08,160
This is how you would modify any section, panel or controller for controllers, you use the get control

52
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:12,720
method for panels, it's get panel for settings, it's jet setting.

53
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:19,019
If you're unsure about a name or an idea or a particular value, it's always good practice to dump the

54
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:21,079
customized object like we did here.

55
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:23,550
I'm going to comment out this bit of code.

56
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:31,890
All right, the last thing I want to do is customize the user experience, whenever we update a setting,

57
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:36,520
you'll notice the page refreshes, which is pretty decent, but the loading time is something that's

58
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,530
not really desired.

59
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:41,970
In this case, we will want to make some settings, not refresh the page.

60
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:46,910
Rather, we can use JavaScript to update the settings to accomplish this.

61
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:52,630
We'll have to make some minor tweaks to the settings we defined earlier, opened the Mesi function and

62
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:55,100
search for the card and search button settings.

63
00:04:55,420 --> 00:05:00,130
I'm going to define a new key called transport and set it to post message.

64
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:11,260
There are two possible values for this key by default, it's refresh, which will instruct WordPress

65
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:17,860
to refresh the page whenever this value is updated by setting it to post message, you're telling WordPress

66
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:21,690
that you will use custom JavaScript code to reflect the changes on the page.

67
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:27,910
Open the file assets, jazz themed customized JS file.

68
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:32,860
I created this file for you already and all it is is an empty query.

69
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:36,060
Initialize your function will be updating this very soon.

70
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:42,120
I only want to load this file if the customizer is loaded, otherwise it would just be a wasted download.

71
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:48,520
To do that, we have to add a new action inside the functions file called Customize Preview.

72
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:53,200
In it, the function to call is Jiyu customize preview init.

73
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:03,620
I'm going to create a file inside the customizer folder called NQ and define the function here.

74
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:13,690
Lastly, I'm going to include it, this hook will only run if the customizer is loaded.

75
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:17,040
Its purpose is for loading stylesheets and scrips only.

76
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:20,640
I'm going to call the WP NQ script function.

77
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:27,170
The ID will be Jiyu theme customizer.

78
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:31,710
Passing the euro like we did previously.

79
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:41,110
The value for the dependencies is very important here.

80
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:45,960
We require two things, which is Jake Query and the customized dash preview.

81
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:53,200
The customized preview file has some helper functions and methods for working with the customizer,

82
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,530
you'll see what those are in just a moment.

83
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:58,000
The version will be false.

84
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,940
And I want to load this in the footer just like that.

85
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:02,550
Our file should now be loaded.

86
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:05,890
Let's go back to the JS file to make the finishing changes.

87
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:14,870
Since the customized JavaScript file is being loaded, we're provided with an object called WP, which

88
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:17,960
contains all the methods and properties related to WordPress.

89
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:23,330
One of these methods is called Customize, which allows you to get the value of a particular setting.

90
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:27,200
In this case, it would be Jiyu header show search.

91
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:34,810
The second parameter for this method is a callback function for using the value the callback function

92
00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:36,460
is provided the current value.

93
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:44,930
I'm going to bind this value so that we can keep an eye out for any changes this method takes in another

94
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:49,850
callback function that's passed in the new value, we will refer to it as New Val.

95
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:58,380
Since this is a check box, we can simply check to see if there's any value set, if there is, then

96
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:01,740
we want to show the search button, otherwise hide it.

97
00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:05,460
The idea of the search button is top dash search.

98
00:08:05,730 --> 00:08:09,990
We can use the show and hide Jake wery methods, respectively.

99
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,880
I'm going to do the same for the cart button.

100
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:23,650
It's the same bit of code, we're just replacing the IDs.

101
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:29,580
Let's refresh the customizer one more time.

102
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:35,460
One thing I should note is that sometimes your code may not be loaded as some browsers will cache files.

103
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:37,380
So be sure to clear your cache.

104
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:42,570
If that's the case, test out the code and you shouldn't see the buttons disappearing depending on if

105
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:43,650
the boxes are checked.

106
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:46,230
You should not have any page refresh.

107
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:51,330
All this is being done with JavaScript code, which makes for a smoother user experience.
