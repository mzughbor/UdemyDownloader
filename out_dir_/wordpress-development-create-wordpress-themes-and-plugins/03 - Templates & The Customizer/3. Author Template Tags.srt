00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:13,420
There are only two sections left inside the single template that are static, those two sections are

2
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:16,490
the author info box and the related post section.

3
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:18,660
Let's tackle the author box first.

4
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:22,060
This lecture will be rather short to start things off.

5
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:27,190
I'm going to replace the name with the author function, which will output the name of the author.

6
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:35,720
For the euro, we can simply echo the variable offer euro, which already contains the URL to the author

7
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:36,290
profile.

8
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:39,780
Nothing really new so far.

9
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:45,700
I'm going to save the image for last, let's skip onto the author description, which is fairly simple.

10
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:51,980
We're going to echo out the function, get the author meta, which will grab a specific value that we

11
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:52,580
can decide.

12
00:00:54,880 --> 00:01:01,480
In the resource section, I provided a link to the author meta function, as I stated earlier, WordPress

13
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:04,090
has a tendency to name their functions like this.

14
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:09,670
The get version returns the value, while the non get version will echo out the value.

15
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:13,840
The reason we want the value returned is because we want to format it.

16
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:16,140
I'll show you what I mean in just a moment.

17
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:19,180
Let's look at the possible values we can pass in.

18
00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:24,660
If you look through this list, you'll eventually find something along the lines of description.

19
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:26,800
This is exactly what we want.

20
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,270
So I'll put that now.

21
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:33,540
Make sure this is echoed out onto the page.

22
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:37,650
I'm going to refresh the page and we get exactly what we wanted.

23
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:41,570
If you don't see description, then chances are the user doesn't have one.

24
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:47,060
And that case go to the admin dashboard and update the users via the user.

25
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:49,240
BIOS doesn't exactly have a limit.

26
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:53,000
If the user had a long bio, then this box can become unreadable.

27
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:55,630
The best way to approach this is to format it.

28
00:01:56,330 --> 00:02:00,530
I'm going to wrap my function with another function called Nele Toubab.

29
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:10,680
This is a specific function that will convert new lines to B-R HTML tags, refresh the page one more

30
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:13,630
time and you should see the description neatly formatted.

31
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:15,030
This is great.

32
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:21,750
Now, you may be wondering why are we using the get version instead of the non get version of this function?

33
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:23,400
Well, it's quite simple.

34
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:27,570
A value that is echoed out cannot be manipulated easily.

35
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:32,670
When you want to make modifications to a value, then you'll want to call a function that returns a

36
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:34,080
value rather than output it.

37
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:37,940
This is specific to AP in general and not WordPress.

38
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:43,230
There is a way to grab values that are already echoed out, but we'll take a look into that later.

39
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:47,160
The very last thing to do is to display the user's avatar.

40
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,050
This is easy to pull off.

41
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:52,650
It's done by echoing out the get avatar function.

42
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:55,790
This is nothing new.

43
00:02:55,900 --> 00:03:02,260
You've used it before when we worked on comets, unlike last time, we'll be using all the parameters

44
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:08,530
as I want to apply a class to this avatar and the resource section, I provide a link to this function.

45
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:14,290
The very first thing we have to pass in is an ID e-mail or a comment object.

46
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:16,570
Any of these three are perfectly fine.

47
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:20,440
We already have the authority so we can just pass that in like.

48
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:28,990
So the second parameter is the size I'm going to pass in the third parameter is the Eurail to a default

49
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:29,890
avatar image.

50
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:34,540
If one isn't available, WordPress already provides one that's just fine with us.

51
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:36,310
So you can pass in an empty string.

52
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:40,440
The fourth parameter is the text to display in the AWALT attribute.

53
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:44,710
I'm going to set this as false since I don't care much for that attribute.

54
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:50,140
The final parameter is an array of other values we can set which are completely optional.

55
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:57,190
I'm going to pass an array with a key of class and its value will be IMG Dasch Circle, which will make

56
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:58,450
the Avatar circular.

57
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,180
That's it.

58
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:03,900
Refresh the page and see if everything works.

59
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:04,690
We're almost done.

60
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:08,250
The very last thing is this related post section.
