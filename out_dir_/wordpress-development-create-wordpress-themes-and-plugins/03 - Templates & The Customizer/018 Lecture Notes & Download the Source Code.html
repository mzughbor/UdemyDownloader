The default template is the <strong>index.php</strong> file.</p></li><li><p>WordPress theme development codex provides recommendations for what each template should have.</p></li><li><p>Quick tags allow you to insert code into a post that will be dynamically changed depending on the quick tag used.</p></li><li><p>The <strong>&lt;!nextpage</strong>quick tag allows you to paginate a post.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Comments Template</strong></p><ul><li><p>You can create a template for comments by creating a file called <strong>comments.php</strong></p></li><li><p>Its important to check if the current post is password protected using the <strong>post_password_required() </strong>function.</p></li><li><p>The <strong>comment_form()</strong> function will display a form while also taking the time to perform additional checks before displaying the form.</p></li><li><p>WordPress saves all comments inside a global variable named <strong>comments </strong>which is available for access inside a loop.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Author Template Tags</strong></p><ul><li><p>Its important to format text using the <strong>nl2br() </strong>function.
