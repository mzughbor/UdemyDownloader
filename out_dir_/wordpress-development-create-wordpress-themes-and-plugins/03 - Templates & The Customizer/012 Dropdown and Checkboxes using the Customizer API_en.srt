1
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:12,910
And this lecture, we're going to continue working with the word press customizer API, there are five

2
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:15,310
fields will be creating that will do the following.

3
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:19,070
The first two fields is for these two button icons on the menu.

4
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:22,630
We'll let the user decide if they want these buttons to be available.

5
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:26,290
The next option is the text for this copyright message on the footer.

6
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:32,259
The last two options will allow users to select the pages for the terms of service and privacy policy

7
00:00:32,259 --> 00:00:32,680
links.

8
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:38,140
Before we get started with the customizer, I'm going to make the search form in the header functional.

9
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:44,560
I'm going to open the header and search form templates, look for the search form inside the header

10
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:45,010
template.

11
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:50,950
You'll notice right away these forms are completely different in appearance and markup, so I won't

12
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:52,990
be using the function for grabbing this template.

13
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:58,140
Instead, I'm just going to copy and paste some of the parts into this template.

14
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:01,720
There are only three things we really need to make dynamic.

15
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:06,340
That would be the action for the form, the value for the input.

16
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:09,010
And lastly, make this text translatable.

17
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:23,250
All right, let's get started with the customizer, I'm going to make a file inside the customizer folder

18
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:27,600
and name it MEAC, which is short for miscellaneous.

19
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:37,520
The final function named J, you might see customizer section, this function will accept the WP customizer

20
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:38,000
object.

21
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:43,450
From the functions file, I'm going to include this file.

22
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:54,140
The very last step is to call this function from the main customizer function.

23
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:04,190
I know that was a lot to do, but trust me, you should always do this as it'll help you keep things

24
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:04,850
organized.

25
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,889
I've been in that situation where I would stuff my code in the least amount of files possible, and

26
00:02:09,889 --> 00:02:16,040
it was always a pain to maintain, just like last time will be using the three step process to create

27
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:16,960
these new settings.

28
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:21,590
The first step is to create the database values using the ADD setting method.

29
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:27,530
The ID for the first setting will be Jiyu header show search and the default value will be yes.

30
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:39,000
I'm going to copy and paste this for more times and update the names for each of these.

31
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:47,040
Feel free to pause the video so that you can have what I have, I have the Jiyu header shoket setting

32
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:53,640
where the default value is also, yes, the Jiyu footer copyright text will have its default value to

33
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,260
the original copyright text.

34
00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:01,080
The Jiyu footer to page and Jiyu footer privacy page will both be set to zero.

35
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,670
These will be assigned to pages later on.

36
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:05,940
That right there is step one.

37
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:08,540
We have all our database settings ready.

38
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:15,600
The next step is to create a section that will hold all our controllers call the ad section method and

39
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:18,960
given the idea of Jiyu Mrs. Section.

40
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:27,940
The title will be Udemy Amici Settings with a priority of 30.

41
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:39,280
The last step is to create the controllers for each setting, the first controller will be a standard

42
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:44,730
HTML input field, so we'll be using the WP customized control class to help us out.

43
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:51,270
As usual, I'm going to pass in the normal stuff, there are a couple of things I should highlight.

44
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:54,930
The Idy will be Jiyu heter show search input.

45
00:03:55,260 --> 00:04:00,750
I will make sure this is assigned to the miscellaneous section and make its settings correspond to the

46
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:02,940
correct settings value we created earlier.

47
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:07,500
Instead of a text input field, I want to create a checkbox.

48
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:10,080
I will set the type to checkbox.

49
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:18,120
The values we use for the checkbook can be set by adding the key choices, this key value will be an

50
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,140
array of possible values available.

51
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:23,100
We only have one value, and that is yes.

52
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:31,180
The name of the key is the actual value that will be compared to check if the setting matches the checkbox,

53
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:37,780
the value of the item is human readable text next to the checkbox so the user knows what the checkbox

54
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:38,260
is for.

55
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:43,630
Let's refresh the customizer and we should now see our section and the checkbox being displayed.

56
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:49,330
As you can see, the checkbox is already checked because the default value for this setting is yes,

57
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:53,050
I want you to do the same for the card button while you're at it.

58
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:55,650
Try creating the copyright text controller.

59
00:04:55,810 --> 00:04:58,390
It's just a text field, nothing complex.

60
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:00,190
Pause the video and try it out.

61
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:04,290
If you didn't get it, that's fine, it's really simple.

62
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:08,760
I'm going to copy and paste the previous controller twice and change a few things.

63
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:10,860
I want you to update the ID.

64
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:19,230
Then I want you to change the label and these settings key for the card button.

65
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:30,730
For the copyright text, I'm going to remove the choices and type keys by default, the type will always

66
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:32,680
be text like last time.

67
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:36,580
You'll only need to change the ID label and these settings key.

68
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:48,450
That should do it for the two buttons and copyright text, the only fields we have to create are the

69
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:49,710
fields for the pages.

70
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:56,100
I'm going to paste this one more time and remove the choices he and update the idee label and settings

71
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,120
keys appropriately.

72
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:10,150
This time, I'm going to change the type to drop down Dasch pages.

73
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:12,190
This is a special type.

74
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:18,280
We can set WordPress or generate a drop down menu and set the options to all the pages that are published.

75
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:22,610
The value of each option will be the page ID, which we can use later.

76
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:29,050
This is exactly what we want since the terms of service and privacy policy will be separate pages.

77
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:34,930
If you don't have a page in mind, then you should set the settings value to zero so WordPress won't

78
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:36,230
set up page by accident.

79
00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:39,520
This controller is for the terms of service.

80
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:45,230
I'm going to copy this and set the idee settings and label for the privacy policy.

81
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:45,550
Now.

82
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:56,880
Just like that, we should have five controllers in the miscellaneous section, refresh the customizer

83
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:01,790
and you should see something similar to what I have, because this is a testing environment.

84
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:06,000
I'm going to set the two page dropdown controllers to some random pages.

85
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:10,050
I'm also going to update the copyright text to something simple.

86
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:17,370
Make sure to save the changes, the last thing we need to do is make these changes, reflect on the

87
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:22,270
theme, open the header template and look for the search and cart buttons.

88
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,710
I'm going to surround these in conditional statements like so.

89
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:50,420
The condition will check if the values for both these mods are set to, yes, make sure to update the

90
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:56,060
values in both these functions to the appropriate setting test to customize your really quick and see

91
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:57,380
if everything works correctly.

92
00:07:57,770 --> 00:08:02,200
The buttons should appear and disappear depending on if the box is checked or not.

93
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:06,570
I'm going to close the header template and open the footer template.

94
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:09,310
Let's get to work for the copyright text.

95
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:11,480
I'm just going to echo out the setting.

96
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:24,270
Next, I'm going to wrap the links in conditional statements and check of the settings have a value.

97
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:28,160
Keep in mind, by default, these settings values are zero.

98
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:30,900
This is also equivalent to false.

99
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:34,150
So we don't need to perform any checks besides what's returned.

100
00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:49,960
Replaced links and use the permalink function.

101
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:59,130
Template tags can we use outside the loop?

102
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:05,490
However, there is one condition you must pass in the ID of the Post or page you like to retrieve information

103
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:09,140
from most template tags have this as their first parameter.

104
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:10,710
Let's do that now.

105
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:15,120
Call the get the mod and get the appropriate setting for each link.

106
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:22,090
If you don't pass in an ID and you're using this function outside of the loop, then you'll receive

107
00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:22,420
an error.

108
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:25,690
Let's check out the site now, save any changes.

109
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:27,790
You made an X out of the customizer.

110
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:30,910
Make sure the links in the footer work after confirming.

111
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:32,290
So then you're all done.

112
00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:34,720
Let's take a moment to explore our theme.

113
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:39,280
When we first started, we had a bunch of links and styles and the content was broken.

114
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:41,770
Now we have a fully functioning theme.
