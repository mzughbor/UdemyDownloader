00:07.890 --> 00:13.620
One section we haven't gotten around to is this breaking news, which is keeping track of popular posts

00:13.620 --> 00:16.600
can be tedious and it's not exactly built into WordPress.

00:17.010 --> 00:20.320
Luckily, there is a plugin out there that will help us out with that.

00:20.820 --> 00:24.960
I want you to go to the admin dashboard and add a new plug in the plug.

00:24.960 --> 00:27.090
And I want to install is called WordPress.

00:27.090 --> 00:30.840
Popular posts install and activate the one by Hektor.

00:31.230 --> 00:36.180
This plugin will automatically help us keep track of what posts are popular by Vieux.

00:39.690 --> 00:46.530
Under settings, you'll find a menu item called WordPress Popular posts here you can control what posts

00:46.530 --> 00:48.720
are popular and additional settings.

00:49.140 --> 00:51.380
We don't need to make any changes at this moment.

00:51.630 --> 00:53.940
Right now, none of the posts are popular.

00:54.510 --> 00:58.650
I'm going to open the homepage within a new tab and view at least three posts.

00:58.900 --> 01:00.330
I want you to do the same.

01:02.660 --> 01:07.850
Refresh the admin page after you've done so, and you'll now see those three posts being displayed as

01:07.850 --> 01:08.780
popular posts.

01:09.140 --> 01:09.700
This is great.

01:09.710 --> 01:12.850
So far there are now two things we need to do.

01:13.130 --> 01:18.410
We need to display the popular posts and then we need to let the user control whether or not they want

01:18.410 --> 01:20.330
to display it while we're at it.

01:20.450 --> 01:23.770
We will also make the text breaking news changeable.

01:24.350 --> 01:30.530
First, let's display these posts inside the WordPress Popular Posts admin page.

01:30.530 --> 01:32.750
I'm going to click on the Parameters tab.

01:33.110 --> 01:37.070
This plugin allows you to display the popular posts two ways.

01:37.310 --> 01:40.790
One way is through a shortcode and the other is through a template tag.

01:41.330 --> 01:43.070
I want to use the template tag.

01:43.370 --> 01:46.670
You'll find a list of parameters we can set to modify the output.

01:46.970 --> 01:48.410
We'll be using these shortly.

01:48.980 --> 01:50.990
Inside the index template.

01:50.990 --> 01:54.650
I want you to perform a conditional check around the popular post widget.

02:03.270 --> 02:09.780
I want to check for two things I want to check of the page being displayed is not a single post and

02:09.780 --> 02:11.730
is the home page using the functions?

02:11.730 --> 02:14.730
Exclamation point is single and is home.

02:17.010 --> 02:22.680
These two functions are at work, press calls, conditional tags, conditional tags or a way to check

02:22.680 --> 02:27.870
what kind of page is being displayed in the resource section, I provide a link to learn more about

02:27.870 --> 02:28.900
conditional tags.

02:29.160 --> 02:31.440
Here is what WordPress has to say about it.

02:32.100 --> 02:37.500
Conditional tags can be used in your template files to alter the display of content depending on the

02:37.500 --> 02:39.630
conditions that the current page matches.

02:40.080 --> 02:44.040
They tell WordPress what code to display under specific conditions.

02:44.340 --> 02:49.020
Conditional tags usually work with P, if else, conditional statements.

02:49.710 --> 02:53.190
The code begins by checking to see if a statement is true or false.

02:53.430 --> 02:57.210
If the statement is found to be true, the first set of code is executed.

02:57.570 --> 03:03.570
If it's false, the first set of code is skipped and the second set of code after the else is executed

03:03.570 --> 03:04.020
and set.

03:04.770 --> 03:09.900
You can read up on this page to learn about the many conditional tags there are, but for now, the

03:09.900 --> 03:12.240
ones we're using will suffice throughout.

03:12.240 --> 03:16.210
This course will be using conditional tags to help us change the final result.

03:16.770 --> 03:17.190
All right.

03:17.400 --> 03:22.500
Now that we know that this is indeed the home page, we can begin displaying the breaking news widget.

03:22.860 --> 03:28.110
I'm also going to check if the WP get most popular function exists.

03:34.240 --> 03:38.230
We can now call a function called WP get most popular.

03:40.520 --> 03:46.240
This function has a one parameter and that is an array of settings we can set back on the admin side,

03:46.250 --> 03:52.100
you'll find that the plug in WordPress popular posts gives plenty of examples on how to use these settings.

03:52.520 --> 03:56.300
There are only three that I want to use and those can be found at the very bottom.

03:57.050 --> 04:00.530
These last three keys determine how the posts are outputting.

04:00.890 --> 04:03.980
The first key we should set is the WP start.

04:11.320 --> 04:17.090
This will be the HTML that will be outputted at the very beginning, we have the static version of widget

04:17.110 --> 04:17.470
here.

04:17.830 --> 04:22.960
I'm going to copy everything from the beginning all the way up to the opening tag with the class of

04:22.960 --> 04:24.170
slider dash wrap.

04:24.730 --> 04:26.800
I'm going to paste this in as the value.

04:29.140 --> 04:34.780
The next key I want to set is the WP, and this should have all the closing tags.

04:39.150 --> 04:44.580
The only thing we have left are these three links, we only need one, so I'm just going to cut one

04:44.580 --> 04:45.700
and get rid of the rest.

04:46.230 --> 04:49.260
The last key to set is the post HTML.

04:49.710 --> 04:53.250
This key value will be the HTML we just cut previously.

04:59.850 --> 05:05.910
Now we have to replace the static parts of this HTML into something like the function will be able to

05:05.910 --> 05:06.990
read and replace.

05:07.680 --> 05:12.450
If you look at the documentation, you'll find that the developer provides you with what values can

05:12.450 --> 05:13.830
be inserted and replaced.

05:14.220 --> 05:19.650
The only ones we're concerned with are the normal and text underscore title content tags.

05:20.070 --> 05:25.770
We just replace the static content with these content tags, make sure to surround them with one pair

05:25.770 --> 05:28.770
of curly brackets so that the plugin will be able to replace the.

05:34.260 --> 05:39.870
Let's refresh the page and you'll see the three posts we previously viewed being displayed as popular

05:39.870 --> 05:44.790
posts, the last thing we need to do is to make it optional to display this widget or not.

05:45.540 --> 05:50.430
Inside the miscellaneous customizer, I'm going to create two new settings.

05:50.760 --> 05:56.580
The first setting is called Jiyu Shohet or popular post widget, which will have a default value of

05:56.580 --> 05:57.110
false.

05:57.510 --> 06:00.060
I don't want this widget to be turned on by default.

06:08.580 --> 06:14.280
The second setting will be Jiyu popular posts, which at title, which will have a default title of

06:14.280 --> 06:15.210
breaking news.

06:22.610 --> 06:24.810
The next step is to create a controller.

06:25.040 --> 06:30.980
I'm going to assign these two controllers to the MEAC section, the first controller will be a checkbox

06:30.980 --> 06:34.520
with an ID of Jiyu show header, popular posts.

06:34.520 --> 06:35.390
Which widget input?

06:48.120 --> 06:54.600
The second controller will just be a text input field with an ID of Jiyu, popular posts, widget title

06:54.600 --> 06:55.020
input.

07:03.660 --> 07:09.480
There's nothing new here after creating these two settings and it's comptrollers, it's time to update

07:09.480 --> 07:11.340
the theme to reflect those changes.

07:11.970 --> 07:15.510
Back inside the conditional statement, I'm going to add one more check.

07:15.810 --> 07:21.810
This will be checking if the theme mod Jiyu show had popular post widget is turned on.

07:24.760 --> 07:31.750
The last thing I'm going to do is change the breaking news static text into its theme, Monju popular

07:31.750 --> 07:32.920
post widget title.

07:36.940 --> 07:43.240
Save your changes and let's check out the customizer, the checkbox should be unchecked, and so therefore

07:43.240 --> 07:45.850
the popular post widget should not be showing.

07:46.330 --> 07:49.810
Try turning it on and then change the text to popular posts.

07:50.200 --> 07:54.970
After confirming if everything worked on the preview, then save your changes and double check on the

07:54.970 --> 07:55.400
front end.

07:56.080 --> 07:56.980
That's it for now.

07:57.100 --> 08:02.190
You'll notice that I spent an awful lot of time talking about other plugins and how to integrate them.

08:02.470 --> 08:05.430
I'm going to show you something in the resources section.

08:05.440 --> 08:09.610
I provide a link to the theme for a site under WordPress.

08:09.610 --> 08:10.630
Popular themes.

08:10.630 --> 08:14.600
You'll notice a lot of themes are killing it and making massive amounts of sales.

08:14.860 --> 08:19.870
I'm going to click on Aveda and you'll notice that this item highlights it's compatible with various

08:19.870 --> 08:22.240
plugins and even comes bundled with some.

08:22.660 --> 08:27.670
It's extremely common to bundle your themes with plugins that help it with certain tasks and functions.

08:28.030 --> 08:33.430
Of course, you'll be put in a situation where you'll have to make your own custom solution and we'll

08:33.430 --> 08:35.750
definitely learn how to make plug in soon.

08:36.190 --> 08:41.830
For now, don't worry, bundling plug ins doesn't make you a bad developer, just a more efficient one.
