1
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:12,760
Right now, I'm in the setup function, I want to start filling in some gaps and adding some features,

2
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:16,120
so that's what we'll do here in the resources section.

3
00:00:16,129 --> 00:00:18,950
I provide a link to the ad theme support function.

4
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:22,430
WordPress provides so many features here that we should use.

5
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:25,550
The first one, we should add, is the feed length feature.

6
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:31,420
WordPress will generate RSS feeds for us and always make sure it's updated with the latest posts.

7
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:36,080
If you're unfamiliar with RSS feeds, you'll see what those look like in just a moment.

8
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:43,170
Inside the setup function, let's use the add theme support function and pass an automatic dash feed

9
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:46,940
dash links which will instruct WordPress to set up some RSS feeds.

10
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:53,220
Refresh the site and you'll notice nothing's really changed, but under the hood, there is one small

11
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:54,450
change, right?

12
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:56,160
Click and view the page source.

13
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:02,580
WordPress will generate these two tags inside the head tag that links to RSS XML feeds.

14
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:06,330
Let's click on this link and you'll be taken to this XML document.

15
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:10,820
The purpose of this document is for RSS readers to scan this document.

16
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,860
This document contains data about your post.

17
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:19,710
RSS feeds provide a way for users to know when new content is available on your site without having

18
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:20,250
to visit it.

19
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:26,250
RSS has been in decline for some time, but there's still a wealthy amount of people still using this

20
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:26,880
technology.

21
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:29,700
Whether or not you want to add it is up to you.

22
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:32,690
For the most part, it's fast and easy to use.

23
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:36,420
The next thing I want to add support for it is HTML5.

24
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:41,670
It can be done by simply calling the same function again and passing in HTML five.

25
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:49,720
If you can remember, WordPress will automatically generate HTML markup for the search form if we didn't

26
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:50,660
have a template for it.

27
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:54,550
This isn't the only time WordPress generates markup for us.

28
00:01:54,910 --> 00:01:59,950
By default, WordPress will make the HTML generated HTML compatible.

29
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:07,450
However, if your theme takes advantage of HTML five tags, then you'll want to enable this HTML5 feature

30
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:09,860
to ensure all markup is up to standards.

31
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:14,680
If you look at the documentation, you'll notice that the second parameter is an array.

32
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:18,060
Every feature can take advantage of the second parameter.

33
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,090
It varies.

34
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:25,240
In the case of HTML five, you can specify which markup will have HTML five applied to it.

35
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:31,570
Even though this parameter is optional, WordPress still wants an array of HTML five elements you'd

36
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:32,370
like to support.

37
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:37,000
I'm going to copy and paste the array from the example into our code like so.

38
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:42,530
The next thing we want to add support for is starter content.

39
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:45,810
This is a brand new feature and WordPress four point seven.

40
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:50,170
The purpose of this feature is a way for developers to add dummy content.

41
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:52,530
When the user is viewing the theme in the customizer.

42
00:02:53,170 --> 00:02:58,810
This dummy content will only be available when the current WordPress installation is fresh, meaning

43
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:04,890
that the user just created the WordPress site and hasn't created any posts, pages or menus.

44
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:10,690
If you take a look at the ad themes support function developer page, you'll notice there's almost no

45
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:12,130
information about this feature.

46
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:19,180
Since it's new, it's lacking in documentation on WordPress, a site instead there is a blog post about

47
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:19,300
it.

48
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:23,390
I'll provide a link to the blog post in the resource section of this lecture.

49
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:25,460
Here's what the team has to say about it.

50
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:30,820
One of the hardest things for people setting up sites with WordPress for the first time is understanding

51
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:35,740
what the jobs are and how a given theme can work for you, especially when there's no content there

52
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:36,610
to visualize.

53
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:43,060
There are also significant gaps between local themed previews, screenshots and previews.

54
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:48,910
Even when there are easy to use site customization tools, it is difficult to figure out where to start

55
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:53,160
and what things are going to be like to help users along that path.

56
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:57,610
Four point seven introduces the concept of starter content themes.

57
00:03:57,610 --> 00:04:03,220
Specific functions of content help showcase a theme to users and serve as a starting point for further

58
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:04,260
set up of new sites.

59
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:10,330
Let's learn how to use it, call the function, add theme support and pass in starter Dasch content.

60
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:17,430
For the second parameter, you'll need to pass in an array of dummy content to save time.

61
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:21,500
I'm going to copy and some code and I'll be going over how all this works.

62
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:23,100
Try and follow along.

63
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:31,200
Unlike the other features, this feature in particular requires that you actually set up the dummy content

64
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:34,950
in this array, you'll find six keys which are all required.

65
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:39,610
I'm going to minimize these for a second so you can get a better overview of what's going on.

66
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,710
Each of these keys are assigned arrays with their own settings.

67
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:45,360
The first is widgets.

68
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:51,030
As you may have thought, the widgets array determines what widgets will be displayed in these sidebars

69
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:51,740
we created.

70
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:56,160
We currently have one sidebar and that is the juice side bar.

71
00:04:56,580 --> 00:05:00,950
You set this as a key and its value will be an array of widgets inside the sidebar.

72
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:06,660
If you look at the blog post, then you'll see that the developers know what kind of predefined widgets

73
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:07,460
you can pass in.

74
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:11,730
I'm going to pass him three widgets called text business info.

75
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:18,000
Search and text about WordPress will automatically generate these widgets with the data they have in

76
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:18,600
their system.

77
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:23,280
Since this is just dummy content, I'm not so worried about what's inside the widgets.

78
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:27,660
As long as something is displayed, the next key is attachments.

79
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:34,140
We haven't talked too much about attachments, but attachments is the post type WordPress uses to associate

80
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:35,180
files and images.

81
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:41,070
If you were to go to the admin dashboard and click on media, you'll be taken to all the attachments

82
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:42,060
we have on our site.

83
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:43,710
It's mostly images.

84
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:51,720
The attachments key allows you to simulate attachments without having to actually upload anything into

85
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:52,630
the media library.

86
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:56,520
This will be an array which will accept an array of images or files.

87
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:59,330
The key will be considered the ID.

88
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:05,730
We only have one image, which is the image dash about inside this array is more information about this

89
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:06,530
file image.

90
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:11,710
There are two required fields which are the human readable name and the location of the file.

91
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,660
The location is relative to the current theme.

92
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:20,960
If I were to open the assets images about directory, you'll find the image right here.

93
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,210
The next key is posts.

94
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,040
This will allow you to define some dummy posts.

95
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:30,790
You'll notice I'm just creating the same kind of posts just under different names.

96
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:36,270
One thing you'll notice is that for the thumbnail key, for each of these posts, I'm using these curly

97
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:36,820
brackets.

98
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:42,350
This will tell WordPress to look for any attachments with the ID of Image Dasch about.

99
00:06:42,690 --> 00:06:45,510
This is the same idea we used in the attachments array.

100
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:48,440
WordPress will be able to make the connection for you.

101
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,880
The next key is the options.

102
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,380
Keep the options.

103
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:56,720
Key allows you to modify the values in the WP Options Database table.

104
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,310
Let's open the WP Options Table.

105
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:01,770
I'm going to be viewing the data in Heidi.

106
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:02,520
Yes, you will.

107
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:04,770
If you prefer my admin.

108
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,370
That's fine.

109
00:07:05,970 --> 00:07:09,240
WordPress stores all its information inside this table.

110
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:13,470
Plugins and themes will also store their data here and this array.

111
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:18,840
The key will correspond to the option underscore name field and the value will correspond to the option

112
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,160
underscore value field.

113
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,770
I'm overriding three options here.

114
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:29,430
The show on front field determines whether the front page will be a page we created or a list of blog

115
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:29,850
posts.

116
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:36,780
I set this to page the page on front is the option for determining what page from our list of pages

117
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:37,950
will be the front page.

118
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:42,510
Since we set show on front to page, this key is required.

119
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:48,240
Once again, I'm using the curly bracket style to tell WordPress that the value will be a post.

120
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:53,360
In our case, it will be the home page we created earlier in the posts array.

121
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,440
We do the same for the page.

122
00:07:55,440 --> 00:08:00,960
For Perski, the key theme models is where we can override our own theme settings.

123
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:04,290
These are the same settings we created in the customizer.

124
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:07,230
The key and values are pretty self-explanatory.

125
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:12,330
The key is the idea of the setting and its value would be the value for that setting.

126
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:17,340
The Laskey should be now menus, which allows us to generate menus.

127
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:20,850
We have two menus which are primary and secondary.

128
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:24,090
These are the same menus we registered in our theme.

129
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:28,200
Each of these have arrays for additional settings about these menus.

130
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,050
First is the name which I make translatable.

131
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:37,230
The items are the actual links you'll notice on using page underscore and link underscore.

132
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:43,470
WordPress will read these values and if it starts with page underscore, WordPress will automatically

133
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:47,520
look at the posts key and see if we have any pages with the same name.

134
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:49,830
So Page underscore about.

135
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:51,630
We'll look for the about page.

136
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:55,230
The link underscore is internal WordPress links.

137
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,650
WordPress will generate its own links, which we can take advantage of.

138
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:01,980
The link underscore home is the link to the home page.

139
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:09,240
I also leave this note here that says Note that the core home page is actually a link in case a static

140
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,500
front page is not used.

141
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:12,840
That wraps up this theme feature.

142
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:18,480
We can't actually test it right away because our WordPress installation is already beyond the point

143
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,260
of a starter site.

144
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:25,500
However, we can temporarily restart it without having to do a fresh install or clean all our posts

145
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:32,400
and settings inside the WP Underscore Options table, there is a value named fresh underscore site.

146
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:34,170
Set this value to one.

147
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:42,110
This will automatically trick WordPress into thinking that this site is a new site, after doing that,

148
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:47,690
go to the customizer and you'll notice our site is completely different than what we see on the homepage.

149
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,790
Keep in mind that this data will only apply to the customizer.

150
00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:56,590
It's a way of previewing our site without actually having to force apply these changes.

151
00:09:56,900 --> 00:10:02,390
I'm going to set the fresh underscore site to zero as we're done with the starter content feature.
