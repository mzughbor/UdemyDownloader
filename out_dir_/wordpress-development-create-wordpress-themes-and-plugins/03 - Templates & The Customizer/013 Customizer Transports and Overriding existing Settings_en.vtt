00:07.270 --> 00:13.090
So far, we've talked about adding settings to the customizer, but what if we wanted to make some changes

00:13.090 --> 00:16.900
to the default customizer that's completely possible and allowed.

00:17.170 --> 00:21.640
If you believe you know a better way, the customizer should be displayed for your theme, then you're

00:21.640 --> 00:23.060
completely allowed to do that.

00:23.350 --> 00:25.660
Let's explore some ways to customize this.

00:26.230 --> 00:31.570
The first thing I want to do is group my sections into something called panels, panels or a way to

00:31.570 --> 00:32.500
group sections.

00:32.680 --> 00:38.170
If the theme customizer had a hierarchy, it would be panels, sections, comptrollers.

00:38.560 --> 00:40.570
Creating a panel is pretty straightforward.

00:42.700 --> 00:47.140
Inside the main customizer file, I'm going to call the ad panel method.

00:49.180 --> 00:54.750
I'm calling this method inside this function instead of a separate file, because it encompasses everything,

00:55.090 --> 00:58.060
however, you're free to organize this however you like.

00:58.360 --> 01:02.530
This method has two parameters, which is the idea and an array of settings.

01:02.770 --> 01:04.900
I'm going to set the ID to you to meet.

01:07.090 --> 01:12.580
The array will have three keys, the first key is the title, which should be human readable.

01:12.800 --> 01:15.940
I'm going to set this to you, to me and make it translatable.

01:18.100 --> 01:23.830
The next key is description, which will be Udemy themed settings, it's important that you add some

01:23.830 --> 01:26.230
P tags as it'll format it properly.

01:28.520 --> 01:34.370
The last key is priority, which will determine the location, the higher the number, the lower placement

01:34.370 --> 01:34.910
it gets.

01:35.120 --> 01:37.100
I'm going to set this to 160.

01:39.360 --> 01:46.350
This will add a panel to the customizer now we can add the sections to this panel to add a section to

01:46.350 --> 01:52.950
a panel, you have to specify it inside the ad section method, open both customizer files for the social

01:52.950 --> 01:59.370
and miscellaneous settings, look for the ad section method calls and add a new key called panel and

01:59.370 --> 02:01.680
pass it in the panel ID, we said earlier.

02:07.470 --> 02:12.630
Refresh the page and you should now see the panel udemy, and if you click on it, you'll find both

02:12.630 --> 02:14.920
sections appearing under it, which is what we wanted.

02:15.600 --> 02:19.590
Now let's talk about customizing existing controllers and sections.

02:19.930 --> 02:22.300
There is this section called Site Identity.

02:22.620 --> 02:25.440
Let's say I wanted to change the title to General.

02:25.680 --> 02:29.760
To do that, you need to grab the section or controller and modify IT settings.

02:30.300 --> 02:36.840
Before we can do that, we have to know the ID of what we want to grab inside the main customized file.

02:36.870 --> 02:40.590
I'm going to vade, dump everything and format it with pre-tax.

02:45.870 --> 02:51.840
Refresh the page and you should see this huge object outputted, you'll find a lot of information related

02:51.840 --> 02:57.000
to the customizer, including all the sections, controllers and panels I'm going to skip to.

02:57.000 --> 02:58.910
These sections are right here.

02:58.920 --> 03:00.960
You'll find all the sections to find.

03:00.960 --> 03:06.900
So far as you can see, you'll find all the keys similar to the ones you can set when using the ADD

03:06.900 --> 03:07.660
section method.

03:08.280 --> 03:13.060
I'm going to look for the section with the title site Identity after finding it.

03:13.110 --> 03:18.230
I now see the ID is titled Tag Line Back inside the customizer file.

03:18.240 --> 03:20.520
I'm going to call the get section method.

03:25.220 --> 03:31.250
This method will grab a section and all its settings you have to pass in the ID, which would be title

03:31.250 --> 03:36.920
tag line, as we saw earlier from here, I can then modify any property I want.

03:37.190 --> 03:41.890
Previously, when using the ad section method, we use an array for the settings.

03:42.140 --> 03:47.510
However, after a section is added, the settings will be converted into an object with properties and

03:47.510 --> 03:48.020
methods.

03:48.320 --> 03:52.490
Because of that, we have to change the settings as if they were properties.

03:52.790 --> 03:55.690
Despite the conversion, the names are usually the same.

03:56.030 --> 03:59.450
In this case, we can set the title to General like so.

04:01.830 --> 04:08.160
This is how you would modify any section, panel or controller for controllers, you use the get control

04:08.160 --> 04:12.720
method for panels, it's get panel for settings, it's jet setting.

04:13.020 --> 04:19.020
If you're unsure about a name or an idea or a particular value, it's always good practice to dump the

04:19.020 --> 04:21.080
customized object like we did here.

04:21.480 --> 04:23.550
I'm going to comment out this bit of code.

04:25.900 --> 04:31.890
All right, the last thing I want to do is customize the user experience, whenever we update a setting,

04:31.900 --> 04:36.520
you'll notice the page refreshes, which is pretty decent, but the loading time is something that's

04:36.520 --> 04:37.530
not really desired.

04:37.870 --> 04:41.970
In this case, we will want to make some settings, not refresh the page.

04:42.190 --> 04:46.910
Rather, we can use JavaScript to update the settings to accomplish this.

04:46.960 --> 04:52.630
We'll have to make some minor tweaks to the settings we defined earlier, opened the Mesi function and

04:52.630 --> 04:55.100
search for the card and search button settings.

04:55.420 --> 05:00.130
I'm going to define a new key called transport and set it to post message.

05:04.870 --> 05:11.260
There are two possible values for this key by default, it's refresh, which will instruct WordPress

05:11.260 --> 05:17.860
to refresh the page whenever this value is updated by setting it to post message, you're telling WordPress

05:17.860 --> 05:21.690
that you will use custom JavaScript code to reflect the changes on the page.

05:22.270 --> 05:27.910
Open the file assets, jazz themed customized JS file.

05:28.300 --> 05:32.860
I created this file for you already and all it is is an empty query.

05:32.860 --> 05:36.060
Initialize your function will be updating this very soon.

05:36.280 --> 05:42.120
I only want to load this file if the customizer is loaded, otherwise it would just be a wasted download.

05:42.700 --> 05:48.520
To do that, we have to add a new action inside the functions file called Customize Preview.

05:48.520 --> 05:53.200
In it, the function to call is Jiyu customize preview init.

05:57.800 --> 06:03.620
I'm going to create a file inside the customizer folder called NQ and define the function here.

06:08.220 --> 06:13.690
Lastly, I'm going to include it, this hook will only run if the customizer is loaded.

06:13.890 --> 06:17.040
Its purpose is for loading stylesheets and scrips only.

06:17.340 --> 06:20.640
I'm going to call the WP NQ script function.

06:24.110 --> 06:27.170
The ID will be Jiyu theme customizer.

06:29.370 --> 06:31.710
Passing the euro like we did previously.

06:38.160 --> 06:41.110
The value for the dependencies is very important here.

06:41.340 --> 06:45.960
We require two things, which is Jake Query and the customized dash preview.

06:48.280 --> 06:53.200
The customized preview file has some helper functions and methods for working with the customizer,

06:53.560 --> 06:55.530
you'll see what those are in just a moment.

06:56.050 --> 06:58.000
The version will be false.

06:58.000 --> 07:00.940
And I want to load this in the footer just like that.

07:00.940 --> 07:02.550
Our file should now be loaded.

07:02.830 --> 07:05.890
Let's go back to the JS file to make the finishing changes.

07:08.720 --> 07:14.870
Since the customized JavaScript file is being loaded, we're provided with an object called WP, which

07:14.870 --> 07:17.960
contains all the methods and properties related to WordPress.

07:18.350 --> 07:23.330
One of these methods is called Customize, which allows you to get the value of a particular setting.

07:23.780 --> 07:27.200
In this case, it would be Jiyu header show search.

07:29.410 --> 07:34.810
The second parameter for this method is a callback function for using the value the callback function

07:34.810 --> 07:36.460
is provided the current value.

07:38.690 --> 07:44.930
I'm going to bind this value so that we can keep an eye out for any changes this method takes in another

07:44.930 --> 07:49.850
callback function that's passed in the new value, we will refer to it as New Val.

07:52.440 --> 07:58.380
Since this is a check box, we can simply check to see if there's any value set, if there is, then

07:58.380 --> 08:01.740
we want to show the search button, otherwise hide it.

08:02.130 --> 08:05.460
The idea of the search button is top dash search.

08:05.730 --> 08:09.990
We can use the show and hide Jake wery methods, respectively.

08:17.680 --> 08:19.880
I'm going to do the same for the cart button.

08:20.140 --> 08:23.650
It's the same bit of code, we're just replacing the IDs.

08:27.330 --> 08:29.580
Let's refresh the customizer one more time.

08:29.880 --> 08:35.460
One thing I should note is that sometimes your code may not be loaded as some browsers will cache files.

08:35.460 --> 08:37.380
So be sure to clear your cache.

08:37.380 --> 08:42.570
If that's the case, test out the code and you shouldn't see the buttons disappearing depending on if

08:42.570 --> 08:43.650
the boxes are checked.

08:44.040 --> 08:46.230
You should not have any page refresh.

08:46.650 --> 08:51.330
All this is being done with JavaScript code, which makes for a smoother user experience.
