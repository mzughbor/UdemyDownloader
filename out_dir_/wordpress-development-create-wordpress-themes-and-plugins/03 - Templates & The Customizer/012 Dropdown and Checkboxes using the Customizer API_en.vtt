00:07.300 --> 00:12.910
And this lecture, we're going to continue working with the word press customizer API, there are five

00:12.910 --> 00:15.310
fields will be creating that will do the following.

00:15.820 --> 00:19.070
The first two fields is for these two button icons on the menu.

00:19.360 --> 00:22.630
We'll let the user decide if they want these buttons to be available.

00:22.900 --> 00:26.290
The next option is the text for this copyright message on the footer.

00:26.500 --> 00:32.260
The last two options will allow users to select the pages for the terms of service and privacy policy

00:32.260 --> 00:32.680
links.

00:33.190 --> 00:38.140
Before we get started with the customizer, I'm going to make the search form in the header functional.

00:38.470 --> 00:44.560
I'm going to open the header and search form templates, look for the search form inside the header

00:44.560 --> 00:45.010
template.

00:45.580 --> 00:50.950
You'll notice right away these forms are completely different in appearance and markup, so I won't

00:50.950 --> 00:52.990
be using the function for grabbing this template.

00:53.590 --> 00:58.140
Instead, I'm just going to copy and paste some of the parts into this template.

00:58.480 --> 01:01.720
There are only three things we really need to make dynamic.

01:01.990 --> 01:06.340
That would be the action for the form, the value for the input.

01:06.340 --> 01:09.010
And lastly, make this text translatable.

01:17.340 --> 01:23.250
All right, let's get started with the customizer, I'm going to make a file inside the customizer folder

01:23.250 --> 01:27.600
and name it MEAC, which is short for miscellaneous.

01:29.780 --> 01:37.520
The final function named J, you might see customizer section, this function will accept the WP customizer

01:37.520 --> 01:38.000
object.

01:40.240 --> 01:43.450
From the functions file, I'm going to include this file.

01:50.330 --> 01:54.140
The very last step is to call this function from the main customizer function.

01:59.300 --> 02:04.190
I know that was a lot to do, but trust me, you should always do this as it'll help you keep things

02:04.190 --> 02:04.850
organized.

02:05.000 --> 02:09.890
I've been in that situation where I would stuff my code in the least amount of files possible, and

02:09.890 --> 02:16.040
it was always a pain to maintain, just like last time will be using the three step process to create

02:16.040 --> 02:16.960
these new settings.

02:17.330 --> 02:21.590
The first step is to create the database values using the ADD setting method.

02:22.040 --> 02:27.530
The ID for the first setting will be Jiyu header show search and the default value will be yes.

02:33.840 --> 02:39.000
I'm going to copy and paste this for more times and update the names for each of these.

02:40.890 --> 02:47.040
Feel free to pause the video so that you can have what I have, I have the Jiyu header shoket setting

02:47.040 --> 02:53.640
where the default value is also, yes, the Jiyu footer copyright text will have its default value to

02:53.640 --> 02:55.260
the original copyright text.

02:55.560 --> 03:01.080
The Jiyu footer to page and Jiyu footer privacy page will both be set to zero.

03:01.500 --> 03:03.670
These will be assigned to pages later on.

03:04.350 --> 03:05.940
That right there is step one.

03:06.240 --> 03:08.540
We have all our database settings ready.

03:08.860 --> 03:15.600
The next step is to create a section that will hold all our controllers call the ad section method and

03:15.600 --> 03:18.960
given the idea of Jiyu Mrs. Section.

03:23.320 --> 03:27.940
The title will be Udemy Amici Settings with a priority of 30.

03:33.550 --> 03:39.280
The last step is to create the controllers for each setting, the first controller will be a standard

03:39.280 --> 03:44.730
HTML input field, so we'll be using the WP customized control class to help us out.

03:46.350 --> 03:51.270
As usual, I'm going to pass in the normal stuff, there are a couple of things I should highlight.

03:51.510 --> 03:54.930
The Idy will be Jiyu heter show search input.

03:55.260 --> 04:00.750
I will make sure this is assigned to the miscellaneous section and make its settings correspond to the

04:00.750 --> 04:02.940
correct settings value we created earlier.

04:03.540 --> 04:07.500
Instead of a text input field, I want to create a checkbox.

04:07.740 --> 04:10.080
I will set the type to checkbox.

04:12.240 --> 04:18.120
The values we use for the checkbook can be set by adding the key choices, this key value will be an

04:18.120 --> 04:20.140
array of possible values available.

04:20.520 --> 04:23.100
We only have one value, and that is yes.

04:25.240 --> 04:31.180
The name of the key is the actual value that will be compared to check if the setting matches the checkbox,

04:31.720 --> 04:37.780
the value of the item is human readable text next to the checkbox so the user knows what the checkbox

04:37.780 --> 04:38.260
is for.

04:38.770 --> 04:43.630
Let's refresh the customizer and we should now see our section and the checkbox being displayed.

04:43.990 --> 04:49.330
As you can see, the checkbox is already checked because the default value for this setting is yes,

04:49.630 --> 04:53.050
I want you to do the same for the card button while you're at it.

04:53.050 --> 04:55.650
Try creating the copyright text controller.

04:55.810 --> 04:58.390
It's just a text field, nothing complex.

04:58.660 --> 05:00.190
Pause the video and try it out.

05:01.560 --> 05:04.290
If you didn't get it, that's fine, it's really simple.

05:04.440 --> 05:08.760
I'm going to copy and paste the previous controller twice and change a few things.

05:08.970 --> 05:10.860
I want you to update the ID.

05:14.490 --> 05:19.230
Then I want you to change the label and these settings key for the card button.

05:23.860 --> 05:30.730
For the copyright text, I'm going to remove the choices and type keys by default, the type will always

05:30.730 --> 05:32.680
be text like last time.

05:32.680 --> 05:36.580
You'll only need to change the ID label and these settings key.

05:43.260 --> 05:48.450
That should do it for the two buttons and copyright text, the only fields we have to create are the

05:48.450 --> 05:49.710
fields for the pages.

05:50.040 --> 05:56.100
I'm going to paste this one more time and remove the choices he and update the idee label and settings

05:56.100 --> 05:57.120
keys appropriately.

06:05.950 --> 06:10.150
This time, I'm going to change the type to drop down Dasch pages.

06:10.780 --> 06:12.190
This is a special type.

06:12.190 --> 06:18.280
We can set WordPress or generate a drop down menu and set the options to all the pages that are published.

06:18.640 --> 06:22.610
The value of each option will be the page ID, which we can use later.

06:22.990 --> 06:29.050
This is exactly what we want since the terms of service and privacy policy will be separate pages.

06:29.440 --> 06:34.930
If you don't have a page in mind, then you should set the settings value to zero so WordPress won't

06:34.930 --> 06:36.230
set up page by accident.

06:36.970 --> 06:39.520
This controller is for the terms of service.

06:39.670 --> 06:45.230
I'm going to copy this and set the idee settings and label for the privacy policy.

06:45.250 --> 06:45.550
Now.

06:51.390 --> 06:56.880
Just like that, we should have five controllers in the miscellaneous section, refresh the customizer

06:56.880 --> 07:01.790
and you should see something similar to what I have, because this is a testing environment.

07:01.800 --> 07:06.000
I'm going to set the two page dropdown controllers to some random pages.

07:06.360 --> 07:10.050
I'm also going to update the copyright text to something simple.

07:12.420 --> 07:17.370
Make sure to save the changes, the last thing we need to do is make these changes, reflect on the

07:17.370 --> 07:22.270
theme, open the header template and look for the search and cart buttons.

07:22.560 --> 07:25.710
I'm going to surround these in conditional statements like so.

07:44.630 --> 07:50.420
The condition will check if the values for both these mods are set to, yes, make sure to update the

07:50.420 --> 07:56.060
values in both these functions to the appropriate setting test to customize your really quick and see

07:56.060 --> 07:57.380
if everything works correctly.

07:57.770 --> 08:02.200
The buttons should appear and disappear depending on if the box is checked or not.

08:02.780 --> 08:06.570
I'm going to close the header template and open the footer template.

08:06.860 --> 08:09.310
Let's get to work for the copyright text.

08:09.320 --> 08:11.480
I'm just going to echo out the setting.

08:19.330 --> 08:24.270
Next, I'm going to wrap the links in conditional statements and check of the settings have a value.

08:24.670 --> 08:28.160
Keep in mind, by default, these settings values are zero.

08:28.630 --> 08:30.900
This is also equivalent to false.

08:30.910 --> 08:34.150
So we don't need to perform any checks besides what's returned.

08:47.170 --> 08:49.960
Replaced links and use the permalink function.

08:56.640 --> 08:59.130
Template tags can we use outside the loop?

08:59.310 --> 09:05.490
However, there is one condition you must pass in the ID of the Post or page you like to retrieve information

09:05.490 --> 09:09.140
from most template tags have this as their first parameter.

09:09.750 --> 09:10.710
Let's do that now.

09:10.860 --> 09:15.120
Call the get the mod and get the appropriate setting for each link.

09:17.380 --> 09:22.090
If you don't pass in an ID and you're using this function outside of the loop, then you'll receive

09:22.090 --> 09:22.420
an error.

09:23.020 --> 09:25.690
Let's check out the site now, save any changes.

09:25.690 --> 09:27.790
You made an X out of the customizer.

09:28.030 --> 09:30.910
Make sure the links in the footer work after confirming.

09:30.910 --> 09:32.290
So then you're all done.

09:32.590 --> 09:34.720
Let's take a moment to explore our theme.

09:34.960 --> 09:39.280
When we first started, we had a bunch of links and styles and the content was broken.

09:39.520 --> 09:41.770
Now we have a fully functioning theme.
