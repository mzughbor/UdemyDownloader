1
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:09,560
Comments deserve a lecture of their own.

2
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:14,540
We'll be taking a look at how to make a template for comments and how to submit a comment.

3
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:17,890
I'm still working inside the single template file.

4
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:22,240
Scroll down until you find a section called Comments right before this.

5
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:24,580
We're going to call the function comments template.

6
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:34,020
This function will look for a template file called Common Stock and load it, let's create that file.

7
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:38,900
Now, I'm going to move the comments from the single template into the comments template.

8
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:52,410
Back inside the single template, I'm going to read the comments template function with a conditional

9
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:52,860
statement.

10
00:00:55,020 --> 00:01:00,030
I want to check for two things, the first thing I want to check is to see if the comments are open

11
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:01,950
using the comments open function.

12
00:01:04,129 --> 00:01:09,560
The second thing I want to check is if there are already comments for this post using the get comments,

13
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:10,370
no function.

14
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:18,080
If there are already comments, then we'll want to display those, even if the comments section is close.

15
00:01:18,730 --> 00:01:20,430
Let's go back to the comments template.

16
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:25,480
I'm going to set up a conditional statement and call the function post password required.

17
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:35,170
This function will check to see if this post requires a password value before viewing it and if the

18
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:41,740
current visitor has not inputted that password, if this returns true, then we shouldn't display anything

19
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:42,330
to the user.

20
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:48,910
In this case, I'll just add a return statement like so you may be wondering, will this really stop

21
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:50,500
the rest of the file from returning?

22
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:53,500
Wouldn't using the exit or day function be better?

23
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:59,200
Well, keep in mind that we're calling this template file using the comments template function.

24
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:05,590
This function includes this file and so we can use the return statement to end this function early.

25
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:12,060
You'll also notice that I'm not even using the post password required function inside the single template.

26
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:17,410
In a way, it would make sense to block the rest of the post from displaying, but we don't have to

27
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:20,190
do that because WordPress already does that for us.

28
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:26,290
The only reason I'm using this function inside the comments template is because the comments template

29
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:28,000
can be used anywhere in our theme.

30
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:30,880
Comments are used everywhere in WordPress.

31
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:34,480
So we want to take into account of those situations as well.

32
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:39,550
Assuming everything is good so far, we can begin displaying the comments and form.

33
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:41,500
I'm going to start with the form.

34
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:44,440
Scroll down to the section that says comment form.

35
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:50,520
I'm going to place this code directly inside the div tag with the ID of response.

36
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:56,200
There is a function variable that will help with generating the form, which is the comment form function.

37
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:03,920
This function has two parameters, which are both completely optional in the resource section of this

38
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:06,360
lecture, I provide a link to this function.

39
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,220
Let's look at the developer page for a second.

40
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:14,710
As you can see, like most WordPress functions, this function is heavily documented.

41
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:19,700
This function will generate a form where a user can submit a comment for a post.

42
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:24,000
You are allowed to create your own form, but this function is pluggable.

43
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:26,380
This is a new phrase we're learning here.

44
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:32,570
Anything in WordPress that is pluggable simply means that plug ins are allowed to extend the functionality

45
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:33,650
of that bit of code.

46
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:39,050
Developers are allowed to add in their own fields or change the way it looks with plugins.

47
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:43,820
So it's always best to use this function rather than creating a form manually.

48
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,760
There are a lot of options we can set here.

49
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:49,130
We won't be defining all parameters.

50
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:54,980
If we were to leave this function as is and do the page, then you'll notice that the form doesn't match

51
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:56,040
the one in our template.

52
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:00,800
This can be fixed easily inside the comment form function.

53
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:02,630
I want you to input an array.

54
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:08,780
This array can have a multitude of values and keys, but will only be setting a few which are mostly

55
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:09,440
ascetics.

56
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:12,470
The first key is the comment field keep.

57
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:20,529
This kid's value will be the actual input field for the common body from the template, I'm going to

58
00:04:20,529 --> 00:04:24,730
cut and paste the HTML for the body into this case value like so.

59
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:37,470
Next up is the rest of the fields, the other fields are defined using the fields key.

60
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:45,030
This key's value will be an array of all the fields available in the comments form, there are three

61
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:48,110
which are the author email and you are out.

62
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:54,870
All you really need to do is set each of these keys values to the corresponding HTML in the static template.

63
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:57,840
I'm going to post this video and do this really quick.

64
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:05,540
All right, I'm back, and as you can see, I cut and pasted the HTML into each corresponding key,

65
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:07,970
there are two things I want you to notice.

66
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:14,820
The first is that for each label, I actually made the text translatable, which is completely optional,

67
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:16,190
but always good practice.

68
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:20,570
The second is that you should take careful notice of the name of each field.

69
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:25,350
It's important that you assign each of these fields, these specific names.

70
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:28,290
This is because we won't be processing the commas.

71
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,040
WordPress already takes care of processing and saving comments.

72
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:35,270
WordPress expects these names for each field.

73
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:36,800
We're almost done.

74
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:43,380
There are three more keys to set which are the class submit, label, submit and title reply keys.

75
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:56,160
The class submit Mickey's value should be the S.O.S classes, the submit button uses in the HTML document,

76
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,930
I'm going to simply cut and paste like so.

77
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:05,520
The label summit will be a translatable string, but says submit comment.

78
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:18,370
The title reply, His value will be leave assman comments span, but it's also translatable.

79
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:29,830
That should do it if you haven't already delete the static comment form, then refresh the page and

80
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:32,090
you should see something similar to what I see.

81
00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:37,410
This may seem like a lot of work, but WordPress handles a lot for us behind the scenes.

82
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:40,360
This function does a lot more than output a form.

83
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:42,130
Let me go over what goes on.

84
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:48,000
First, WordPress checks to see if the user is logged in and can submit comments.

85
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:51,310
It'll also check if comments are open for submission.

86
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:55,170
It'll also take care of submitting the correct post information.

87
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:58,690
This comment belongs to try submitting a comment, if you like.

88
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:04,750
Something I should also note is that the form may be different if you are not logged in.

89
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:07,960
I want you to log out of WordPress and check the form.

90
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:16,620
As you can see, WordPress displays these extra fields for logged out users.

91
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:20,390
I'm going to log back in and then go back to the comments.

92
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:30,920
If you wanted to, you could have just written this logic yourself, but that's overcomplicating things,

93
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:34,820
using this function is much more simpler, cleaner and efficient.

94
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:40,700
If you wish to customize this form further than I highly recommend, you read up on the documentation

95
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:41,280
to do so.

96
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:44,090
Now it's time to display the comments.

97
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:49,430
Scroll all the way up to the comments list section inside the ordered list.

98
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:52,520
Hagg, I want you to delete all of the comments except one.

99
00:07:54,750 --> 00:08:01,770
We will be using the single comment as a reference, then set up a foreach loop, WordPress puts all

100
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:04,950
the post comments in a handy little variable called comments.

101
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:09,630
We're going to loop through each element in this array and refer to it as comment.

102
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,790
You don't have to worry about tying us all together as WordPress, does it, for you, it will automatically

103
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:19,950
create the comments variable for you.

104
00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:24,090
I'm going to cut and paste that single comment into this loop like so.

105
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:37,559
Just like the loop before, all we have to do is simply replace the static content with template tags,

106
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:45,180
the first template tag for comments is the get avatar function inside the div tag with the class comment

107
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:50,100
dash author, replace the image tag and echo out the get avatar function.

108
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:59,260
This function in general gets the avatar of a user, usually we can leave this function like so, however,

109
00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:02,200
we're using it inside a loop that's inside of a loop.

110
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:04,650
This makes things confusing for this function.

111
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:08,440
So we have to pass in the comment object itself.

112
00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:16,840
WordPress will be able to scan this object for the idea of the user to get the correct avatar, the

113
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:19,870
second parameter would be the size for this template.

114
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:21,750
The size 60 is perfect.

115
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:26,240
The third parameter is the default image URL if the user doesn't have one.

116
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:32,180
I'm going to pass in an empty string, which will tell WordPress to handle the default image URL.

117
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:36,190
I'm also going to pass in an empty string for the fourth parameter.

118
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:40,960
The value for this must be the text to display inside the alt attribute.

119
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:45,730
I don't want to display anything in the alt text, so only this empty.

120
00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:48,940
The fifth parameter is an array of additional settings.

121
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:52,120
I'm going to pass that in and set the Klasky.

122
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:57,070
The value of this should be the classes inside, the image tag below.

123
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:06,820
Scrolling down, you'll find a div tag with declasse comment author.

124
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:10,990
I'm going to replace the static author name with the function comment author.

125
00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:18,520
Unlike the previous function comment, specific functions will only grab its values from the current

126
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:19,520
comment in the loop.

127
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:23,080
This function will output the name of the author of this comment.

128
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:29,530
The next one is the comments date function, which returns a formatted date when the comment was made.

129
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:36,620
Lastly, we use the function comments, text to return the text made by the user.

130
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:44,480
Nothing much to it, honestly, if we refresh the page, then you'll see the comment we made previously

131
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:48,740
appear, the very last thing we need to do is add comments pagination.

132
00:10:49,070 --> 00:10:53,450
You simply call the comments pagination function right after the loop.

133
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,870
This next step is completely optional.

134
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:06,320
I don't want to display this part of the template unless there are comments, I'm going to wrap this

135
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,660
bit of code inside a conditional statement.

136
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:24,680
I'm going to use the House of Commons function to check to see if there are any comments.

137
00:11:27,090 --> 00:11:33,580
I'm also going to display the number of comments inside this age three tag using the comments, no function.

138
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:36,830
Make sure you remove the comments text as well.

139
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:43,800
That's it for the comments template, you may be wondering, but what about spam protection?

140
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:48,150
Actually, spam protection is something we can leave to plug in developers.

141
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:54,060
There are dozens of plug ins available to block spam, and so we won't bother adding a built in system

142
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:54,660
ourselves.

143
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,200
It would be a bit overkill.

144
00:11:56,910 --> 00:12:00,200
All comments are processed through a particular file.

145
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:08,010
If we look at the WordPress installation, you'll see the WP dash comments dash post file inside the

146
00:12:08,010 --> 00:12:08,800
root directory.

147
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,390
This file will process all comments posted to it.

148
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:13,870
Feel free to check it out.

149
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:15,090
That's it for now.

150
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:18,480
In the next few lectures will finish up the single template.
