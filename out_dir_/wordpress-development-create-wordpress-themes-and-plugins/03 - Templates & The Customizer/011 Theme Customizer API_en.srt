1
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:13,690
We are now going to take a look at the theme customizer API, the theme customizer is WordPress is UI

2
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:15,000
for customizing the theme.

3
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:17,320
This is enabled by default for you.

4
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:23,890
Already you can view the customizer by going into the admin dashboard and navigating to appearance customize

5
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:25,390
on the sidebar.

6
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:30,360
You'll find a few options for changing the theme and you'll see our theme being displayed on the right.

7
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:32,049
Let's see how this works.

8
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:35,590
Click on site identity and try changing the site title.

9
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:43,800
Right after making these modifications, WordPress will actually update the preview, what WordPress

10
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:46,620
is doing is loading the site inside an iFrame.

11
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:52,140
Every time a change happens, WordPress will refresh the iFrame with the modified data.

12
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:56,870
Keep in mind that this doesn't take an official effect until you click save.

13
00:00:57,540 --> 00:01:03,150
What makes this customizer even more powerful is that developers are provided an API to add in their

14
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:04,420
own options and settings.

15
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:06,480
So here's what we're going to do.

16
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:11,180
We're going to create some settings to add social links in the header and footer.

17
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:17,700
We're going to make everything here dynamic, open the functions, file and add an action, hook.

18
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:21,390
The action we want to hook into is called Customize Register.

19
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:29,470
This is the hook WordPress, cause when it starts to set up the theme customizer, the function to call

20
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:31,990
will be called Jiyu Customized Register.

21
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:41,240
Create a file called Theme Dasch Customizer inside the includes folder and define the function here.

22
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:52,690
Lastly, include this file from the functions file.

23
00:01:57,730 --> 00:02:03,820
This function will be passed in one variable named WP Customize, this is an object with methods and

24
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:06,280
properties for modifying within customizer.

25
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:11,650
This object is an instance of the WP Customize Manager class.

26
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:14,870
I'll provide a link to this class in the resource section.

27
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:21,280
This class controls how the customizer works, and most of its functionality will be going over how

28
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,950
this works shortly before we begin working on the customizer.

29
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,770
There are three important concepts you need to know if you don't understand right away.

30
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:31,750
After I explain it, then that's fine.

31
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:33,720
I'll be showing you how it works.

32
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:41,580
There are three steps you'll usually take when working with the customizer directly, the first step

33
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:42,570
is adding a setting.

34
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:47,850
The setting is just a value that you save in the database and can be modified through the customizer.

35
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:50,200
You can then use this value in your theme.

36
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:53,130
The second step is creating a section.

37
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:56,480
A section is a way to group a bunch of fields together.

38
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:02,280
If you look at the customizer, you'll notice that things are grouped together instead of just displaying

39
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,330
every option together.

40
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:06,570
This makes it easier to control and navigate around.

41
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:09,510
The third step is creating a controller.

42
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:16,290
A controller is just an input field, checkbox, color picker or uploader that allows you to change

43
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:18,390
the setting you made in step one directly.

44
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:25,510
Let's get started with the customizer, the object passed in has a couple of methods.

45
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:30,280
The method for adding a new setting is called add setting, and it's called like so.

46
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:34,570
This method has two parameters.

47
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,760
The first is the ID like anything else.

48
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:41,680
The idea is something that should be unique so we can refer to it later.

49
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:45,160
I'm going to set this to Jiyu Facebook handle.

50
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:53,250
The next parameter is an array of settings, I'm going to provide a link in the resource section of

51
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:55,650
the lecture for more information about this method.

52
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:59,030
If you scroll down a bit, you'll see a few settings you can set.

53
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:03,350
Most of them are optional except one setting, which is the default key.

54
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:05,750
I'm going to set this as an empty string.

55
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:15,980
That's all you need to do, one thing I should mention is this setting called transport.

56
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:20,360
This controls how the value is reflected on the main theme during preview mode.

57
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:22,910
By default, it's set to refresh.

58
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:28,550
This means that when this value is changed, then the page will refresh and show that value.

59
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:34,750
If you want to control how this value is reflected on the theme, you will need to set this to post

60
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:35,360
message.

61
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:41,300
However, refresh will work in 90 percent of the time, so will leave this value as is.

62
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:47,720
This value will now be saved in the database and it can now be manipulated through controllers and be

63
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,900
displayed on our theme.

64
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:53,300
We now have to create a section to create a section.

65
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:55,520
We have to call the ad section method.

66
00:04:57,770 --> 00:05:00,630
The first parameter is the ID for this section.

67
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:04,100
I'm going to set this to Jiyu social section.

68
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:12,590
The second parameter is an array of settings, the title will be translatable and I'll set it to you,

69
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:13,910
to me social settings.

70
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:25,260
Next is the priority, the lower the number, the higher placement it will receive and vice versa.

71
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:27,170
I'm going to set this to 30.

72
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:32,970
There's one last method I want to call, which is the ad control method.

73
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:41,400
This will create an input field and added to a particular section of our choosing, this method is a

74
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:44,100
bit tricky because there are two ways you can set this up.

75
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:48,630
The first way is to pass in the settings and have more control over it.

76
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:52,420
However, this tends to be confusing if you don't know what you're doing.

77
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:59,250
The second route is to pass in an object that will help you create the field you'd like to create will

78
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:04,340
be going with the second route because it's really easy to get started in the resource section.

79
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:06,810
I provide a link to the add control method.

80
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,600
Scroll down to the classes section.

81
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:14,610
This section provides a couple of classes that can be passed and that will assist us with filling in

82
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:15,180
the blanks.

83
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:23,580
The WP customized control class will help you create fields such as text fields, radio buttons, checkboxes

84
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:24,450
and drop downs.

85
00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:27,780
The color control will create a color picker for you.

86
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:31,680
The upload control will create a field for uploading files.

87
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:37,830
The image control also does something similar to the upload control, except you can only upload images.

88
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:43,620
These other two are unimportant to us as WordPress uses these internally for its own purpose.

89
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:47,190
So we won't be messing with them at all throughout this lecture.

90
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:49,040
For our purposes.

91
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:54,170
The first class is perfect for us since we want to create a TextField for the users handle.

92
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:59,730
I'm going to click this and you'll see that WordPress provides an example on how this works.

93
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:03,150
I'm going to copy and paste this and go over what's going on.

94
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:12,710
The first parameter is the customizer object itself, the controller needs to know more about what's

95
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:15,650
happening in the customizer so that it can fill in the blanks for you.

96
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,410
The second parameter is the ID for this controller.

97
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:23,630
I'm going to set this as use social Facebook input.

98
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:31,750
The last parameter is an array of additional settings, we will only concern ourselves with these four

99
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:32,280
keys.

100
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:35,820
The label is just text to describe the field.

101
00:07:36,130 --> 00:07:38,310
This should be a translatable string.

102
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:41,110
I'm going to set this as Facebook handle.

103
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:50,760
The U.S. is where it'll appear, we created our own section called Giuse Social Section will assign

104
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,350
this control under that section.

105
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:58,520
The next key is settings, which is what setting will this field modify?

106
00:07:58,910 --> 00:08:00,710
We created this in step one.

107
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:04,130
The value for this will be Jiyu Facebook handle.

108
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:11,170
The last key is type, which is what kind of field this will be by default.

109
00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:19,150
It'll be text, there's also radio, text area, etc. You can find all the types of fields in the documentation.

110
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:21,280
For now, the default is fine.

111
00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:23,970
I'm actually just going to remove this key.

112
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:26,350
We are now finished with the customizer.

113
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:31,870
Let's refresh the customizer and you will now see this new section called Udemy Social Settings.

114
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,990
After clicking it, you'll now see the controller.

115
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:38,110
I'm going to input Udemy and save the setting.

116
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:43,630
However, nothing in the preview will change because we haven't told WordPress where we'd like to use

117
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:44,140
this setting.

118
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:47,680
Let's review what we did in our customize function first.

119
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:52,930
The first step was to create the setting, which is the value that's stored in the database.

120
00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:57,150
The second step is to create a section that will group various controllers.

121
00:08:57,460 --> 00:09:02,920
The third step was to create a controller that is assigned under a section and controls one setting.

122
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:08,800
A lot of people get confused with the difference between the ad setting and add control methods.

123
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:11,530
The setting will create the database value.

124
00:09:11,830 --> 00:09:14,440
The method will not create an input field.

125
00:09:14,650 --> 00:09:19,660
It will just tell WordPress about the setting and tell it to create a setting in the database.

126
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:23,560
The control method will not create a database value.

127
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,500
Instead, it will create an input field.

128
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:32,230
The controller will take care of modifying and updating the database value whenever the input field

129
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:32,830
is updated.

130
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:33,780
All right.

131
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:37,030
Now that we've cleared that up, let's start making our theme.

132
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:40,810
Recognize the changes inside the header template.

133
00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:46,150
Let's locate a list of social icons in the header inside a conditional statement.

134
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,910
I'm going to call the function, get the mod.

135
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:59,520
This function will grab a setting you pass in if there is no value or the value does not exist, then

136
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:00,810
this will return false.

137
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,230
I'm going to pass in Jiyu Facebook handle.

138
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:12,650
This is the setting we created earlier, if there is a value, then we'll output this one list item,

139
00:10:12,650 --> 00:10:14,120
which is the Facebook link.

140
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:18,080
I'm going to move the static link inside the conditional statement.

141
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:28,250
Then I'm going to replace the Eurail for this with the Facebook Eurorail, followed by the value returned

142
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:34,160
by the theme mod function, we will have to echo out the value since the function will only return it.

143
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:39,930
That's it.

144
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:43,690
Let's go back to the customizer and you will now see Airlink appearing.

145
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:49,650
If I were to empty out this textfield, you'll notice the iFrame refresh and the link disappear.

146
00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:51,750
This is exactly what we want.

147
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:55,280
The only thing left to tackle is the rest of these icons.

148
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,260
I want you to try this on your own.

149
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:59,860
Actually, before I let you off.

150
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:01,700
There's one thing we should do together.

151
00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:06,110
Create a folder inside the includes folder named Customizer.

152
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:12,950
Then create a file named Social P inside this file.

153
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:16,750
Create a function named J use social customizer section.

154
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:23,810
This function will accept BWP customized object.

155
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:28,750
I'm going to cut and paste the contents from the main customizer function into this function.

156
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:36,520
Then I'm going to call this function from the main customizer and pass in the customize object.

157
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:44,900
The last step is to just include this social customizer file.

158
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:56,250
By doing this, we make things a lot cleaner and easier to manage, these social icons aren't the only

159
00:11:56,250 --> 00:12:01,800
things we'll be using the customizer for this year is just preference and not required by WordPress

160
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:02,300
itself.

161
00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:04,820
I just like to stay organized and clean.

162
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:07,680
I want you to create the new settings.

163
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:11,580
Now all you'll be doing is creating new settings and controllers.

164
00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:14,490
You only need one section which we already defined.

165
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:18,840
Once you have those ready, then you can modify the theme itself to include the links.

166
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:21,970
Welcome back.

167
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:25,990
If you weren't able to do it, then no worries, I have you covered.

168
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:29,190
As you can see here, I already have everything set up.

169
00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:35,200
I'm going to provide these social customizer function in the resource section so that you can download

170
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,880
it and compare it to your own function.

171
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:42,940
I also made modifications to the header and footer to include these settings onto the theme.

172
00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:48,660
I won't be providing these as these are just really simple and aren't as difficult to replicate.

173
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:53,740
If you don't know how to do this, then you really need to rewash this lecture because there's nothing

174
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:55,450
advanced going on in these templates.

175
00:12:55,930 --> 00:12:57,700
I'll see you in the next lecture.
