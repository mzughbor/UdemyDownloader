1
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:13,360
WordPress is very smart and powerful, as you can already tell, it handled most of the logic for us.

2
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:17,560
It can handle even more logic for us by selecting which templates to load.

3
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:21,330
Right now, we only have one template, which is the index template.

4
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:27,520
However, we can create multiple templates for different pages, such as for all fours, single blog

5
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:30,470
posts, pages, archives and so much more.

6
00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:36,490
The question is, how do we make WordPress acknowledge we have multiple templates and which one is meant

7
00:00:36,490 --> 00:00:39,550
for which type of page and the resource section?

8
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:43,170
On this lecture, I provide a link to the WordPress template hierarchy.

9
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:46,270
What you'll see here isn't the WordPress codex.

10
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:51,070
What this actually is, is a free theme handbook created by WordPress.

11
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:56,830
You'll find a lot of information on how to create themes, and it's especially useful if you're new

12
00:00:56,830 --> 00:00:59,070
to team development right now.

13
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:02,230
I skipped to the Template Hierarchy chapter of this book.

14
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:04,209
You'll find a diagram here.

15
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:09,660
The diagram shows us the order in which WordPress uses to load a particular template.

16
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,920
It starts from left to right.

17
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:13,330
First things first.

18
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:16,840
WordPress will check what kind of page type is being loaded.

19
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:21,610
Is it loading an archive, single post or maybe a 404 has occurred.

20
00:01:21,970 --> 00:01:26,210
Then it'll go through the diagram and try to find the correct file to load.

21
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:29,830
For example, let's say we're on a 404 page.

22
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:36,850
If we look at the diagram and follow the line, you'll see WordPress will first look for a 404 file.

23
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:42,790
If it finds that file, then it'll use that as a template and stop searching for a template to use.

24
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:46,990
Otherwise, WordPress will just load the index template.

25
00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:53,860
Actually, if you take a look at the overall diagram, all points eventually lead to the index template.

26
00:01:53,860 --> 00:02:01,060
If nothing is found, we could if we wanted to just use an index template and then add our own logic

27
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:03,510
to check to see what kind of pages being loaded.

28
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:04,900
But that's overkill.

29
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:10,360
It would be so much simpler to just use the template hierarchy WordPress provides out of the box.

30
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:12,460
You don't have to write any logic.

31
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:14,710
WordPress handles it all for us.

32
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:17,920
Let's go back to the Template Hierarchy page.

33
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:23,950
On this page, you'll find more info on how the process works and which templates have precedence over

34
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:24,400
others.

35
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:30,730
For example, if I scroll down further, I'll eventually find information about the fall for template

36
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:35,080
WordPress documents what template files WordPress will search for.

37
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:41,500
It's usually best to go through this document to better understand how the template hierarchy works,

38
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:44,850
especially if you have a hard time following the diagram.

39
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:52,510
Another useful resource is this site called WP Hierarchy dot com, which I also provide in the resource

40
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:53,590
section of this lecture.

41
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:57,760
It's very similar to the image we looked at earlier, except it's interactive.

42
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:02,860
You can click on a particular template and you'll be taken to the page with relevant information.

43
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:08,590
I highly recommend you bookmark this for future reference after you finish this lecture.

44
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:12,790
I also recommend you read this guide on how it works and our theme.

45
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:19,450
We will be creating templates for single post pages, categories, search results for all four pages

46
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:20,170
and even more.

47
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:24,940
Right now, I want you to go to your site and click on a single blog post.

48
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:30,820
You'll see that WordPress takes care of querying everything and displaying only a single post.

49
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:31,870
That's great.

50
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:33,940
But there's a few noticeable problems.

51
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:36,850
Our post is only showing the excerpts.

52
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:42,820
It has this read more button, which we don't need, and it also isn't showing tags or comments.

53
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:49,360
We could add logic to the index template to check to see if this is a single post, but I think creating

54
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,540
a template for this would be so much better, cleaner and efficient.

55
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:56,680
Before we move forward, I want to talk about post types.

56
00:03:56,980 --> 00:04:00,460
Post types are a way to describe different types of content.

57
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:07,030
If you were to go to the admin dashboard, then you'll see that WordPress provides two post types called

58
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:08,440
posts and pages.

59
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:14,350
If you were to view their edit pages, then you'll see that there are some similarities in terms of

60
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:14,830
you want.

61
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:17,890
However, they're meant for different types of content.

62
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:24,190
WordPress provides you the ability to create your own custom post types, but we'll discuss that when

63
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:25,570
we start plugin development.

64
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:31,240
All you need to know is that post types are a way to categorize different pieces of content.

65
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:40,110
The template we're going to create is a template for the post post type word press will look for five

66
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:41,130
certain templates.

67
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:47,280
First, it'll look for a file called Single Dash, followed by the name of the post type and then the

68
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:53,730
slug, for example, if I had a post with the slug, hello, then the file name would be single dash

69
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:54,620
post dash.

70
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:54,970
Hello.

71
00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:01,200
This can be very helpful if you want to create a specific template for a specific page.

72
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:06,300
WordPress really allows you to control the design of your site with the template hierarchy.

73
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:12,090
The next template to look for is the single dash, followed by the name of the prototype.

74
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:16,530
For example, it'll look for a file named Single Dash Post Dot.

75
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:22,890
Then WordPress will search for the single DOT template, then be singular.

76
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:26,610
And lastly, the indexed HP template.

77
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:31,080
The index top is the fallback template for every situation.

78
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:36,930
This is why WordPress forces us to create it in order for our theme to be officially recognized.

79
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:42,540
So you may be wondering what's the difference between singled out and singular?

80
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:47,740
The single dot p p template is custom post types only.

81
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:50,700
This also includes the post post type.

82
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:53,430
WordPress provides its own post types.

83
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:56,060
There's about six, but we'll look into that later.

84
00:05:56,460 --> 00:06:01,860
This means that there's two types of post types which are the ones provided by WordPress and ones that

85
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:03,450
come bundled with WordPress.

86
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:09,740
The ones that come bundled with, with the exception of posts, don't use the single PHP template.

87
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:12,720
Instead they get assigned their own templates.

88
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:16,980
The singular template is a universal post type template.

89
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:23,600
It doesn't matter if the post type is custom or inbuilt, the singular template will be used.

90
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:24,780
That's all there is to it.

91
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:34,870
We're going to keep things simple will be creating the single template, create this file now I'm going

92
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:39,100
to just simply copy and paste the code from the index template to the single template.

93
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:44,450
We can now begin modifying this template to suit our needs.

94
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:51,370
First, I want to remove everything inside this div tag with the idea of posts and the pagination.

95
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:55,310
I also want to remove the breaking news at the very top.

96
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:07,510
Next, open the single door HTML template file inside the assets folder, I want you to look for the

97
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:10,330
div tag with the class single dash post.

98
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:17,100
Copy everything here and then paste it in the spot where we deleted the previous diptych.

99
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:24,450
So we're kind of back to where we started, but that's fine, because this gives us the opportunity

100
00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:25,320
to fix everything.

101
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:30,130
Unlike the index template, there are a couple of sections here we didn't go over.

102
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:31,110
That's fine.

103
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:34,170
I'll show you how to tackle those extra sections.

104
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,320
For now.

105
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:40,020
What I want you to do is to remake the loop and fill in the blanks as much as you can.

106
00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:41,940
Pause the video if you need to.

107
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,450
All right, let's do this together.

108
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:48,940
The first step is to check if there are any posts using a conditional statement.

109
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:57,780
Then we'll begin the loop inside the loop, we'll call the post function.

110
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:05,040
Now, I'm just going to cut and paste this code inside the loop like so.

111
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:20,300
If you need a refresher, I suggest you watch the previous lectures, if you were confused by what we

112
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:26,270
did so far at this point, the only thing we need to do is use template tag functions to replace the

113
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:27,110
static content.

114
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:30,060
First up is the actual post itself.

115
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:32,220
Let's go through this one by one.

116
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:36,260
Replace the text inside the tag with the title function.

117
00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:45,560
Echo out the date, use the category template tag, then use the comments, no template tag.

118
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:58,230
For the single template, we display more information about the author other than their name, and in

119
00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:01,580
this case, we want to keep our code clean and not repeat code.

120
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:06,300
The best way to do this is by using variables at the top of the loop.

121
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:09,250
I'm going to include the Global Post variable.

122
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:12,430
This variable is created for you by WordPress.

123
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:15,430
WordPress will define a lot of variables for you.

124
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:19,450
This variable in particular will contain properties about the post.

125
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:24,570
One of these properties is Post author, which contains the ID of the author.

126
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:30,550
Let's create a variable named Author ID and set its value to post post author.

127
00:09:32,830 --> 00:09:39,000
Next, create a variable named Author You URL and set its value returned by the get author posts you

128
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:42,280
URL function, make sure to pass him the author ID.

129
00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:52,600
Now we can just echo out the URL and use the author template tag like so.

130
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:04,610
For the featured image, I'm going to use the same code from the index template and paste it into the

131
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:05,990
single template like so.

132
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:19,120
I'm going to make a small modification, I'm going to remove this array, since I don't need the Fada

133
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:26,260
fetch, let's move onto the content itself instead of using the the excerpt function will be using the

134
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:27,400
content function.

135
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:38,700
This function will display the full contents of the post, which is what we want, instead of a summary.

136
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:42,660
Lastly, I'm going to call a function called the tags.

137
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:47,790
I'm going to place this function inside the div tag with the class tag cloud.

138
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:55,930
This function will include all tags related to this post and take care of comma separating all the tags,

139
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:58,840
it'll also generate a link for each tag.

140
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:04,780
This function has three parameters which are all optional, will only concern ourselves with the first

141
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:08,470
to the first parameter, will display text before the tags.

142
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:12,880
I don't want to display any text, so I'll just pass in an empty string.

143
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:15,610
The second parameter will be the separator.

144
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:18,010
I'm just going to pass in a space.

145
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:19,590
The default value is comma.

146
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:23,170
Let's check out the single post and see if everything is working.

147
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:31,420
If you don't see tanks, then it's probably because you don't have tanks attached to the post and that

148
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:36,820
case, just quickly add some and then check back on the page, you should see something similar to what

149
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:37,240
I have.

150
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:38,740
We're almost done.

151
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:44,650
There's actually a few things WordPress recommends we do to make our theme compatible with most WordPress

152
00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:45,070
sites.

153
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:52,050
In the resource section, I provide a link to the theme development codecs on the contents sidebar.

154
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:54,250
I want you to click single post.

155
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:59,890
If you scroll up and down, you'll notice WordPress jots down some important notes for us to know when

156
00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:00,970
creating templates.

157
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:04,770
You shouldn't consider these rules, but more as recommendations.

158
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:09,370
So let's see what WordPress has to say about the single post template.

159
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:16,170
The first thing it recommends is that we should call a function called WP link pages per patinated posts.

160
00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:19,390
What exactly does this do and how does it work?

161
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:23,170
Well, WordPress provides a feature called Patinated Posts.

162
00:12:23,530 --> 00:12:29,350
Rather than create multiple posts, you can create one single post with page breaks.

163
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:36,820
To test this out, you'll need to edit a post any post will do then somewhere in the middle at a block.

164
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:40,270
The block, you should add, should be called page break.

165
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:44,440
What this will do is break the content into multiple pages.

166
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:49,750
This is useful if you have an extremely long post and would like to pagination it into separate pages.

167
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:56,110
This way you don't have to manually create a post for one long post and link all the posts together

168
00:12:56,110 --> 00:12:56,650
yourself.

169
00:12:57,310 --> 00:12:59,440
Save this and then let's do the post.

170
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:03,260
You'll notice it won't work right away.

171
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:09,700
This is because we haven't called the WP link pages function, called this function right after the

172
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:10,750
content function.

173
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:19,790
Let's refresh the post and you should now see the Post being patinated into separate pages.

174
00:13:20,390 --> 00:13:21,270
This is really great.

175
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:24,760
The best part is we didn't have to do much to get this working.

176
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:28,250
I'm going to provide a link to this function to learn more about it.

177
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:32,450
Actually, now that I look at it, I want to centralists.

178
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:38,840
If we take a look at the documentation, you'll see it says we can pass an array to customize this further.

179
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:45,710
The before and after keys is the text HTML that is displayed before the list.

180
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,670
There's even an example usage provided.

181
00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:53,810
Let's use that and remove everything but the before and after keys in the array.

182
00:13:54,290 --> 00:13:58,390
Bootstrap provides a handy class called Text That Center.

183
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:03,380
So we'll just modify this paragraph tag and add the class text dash center.

184
00:14:08,090 --> 00:14:11,270
Let's refresh the page to see if Artex is now centered.

185
00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:19,240
Let's keep going down the list, we're already displaying the title and content so we can skip those.

186
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:21,880
The post date is already being displayed.

187
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:25,380
We're already displaying the categories and links.

188
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:26,860
So let's skip that.

189
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:28,690
What it's suggesting.

190
00:14:28,690 --> 00:14:32,530
We provide an edit link, but I'm going to ignore this suggestion.

191
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:38,440
If we were to read the post, you'll notice WordPress already provides this top bar with a link to edit

192
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:41,510
the current post so we don't need to add our own.

193
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:46,070
Now it's recommending we display comments and a forum for submission.

194
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:51,060
I'm going to cover this in a future lecture as comments deserve its own kind of lecture.

195
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:55,510
So let's skip over this one for now and move on to the last and final point.

196
00:14:56,230 --> 00:15:02,440
WordPress now recommends we add links to any posts posted previously or after this post.

197
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:08,530
We can do this by simply calling the previous post link and next post link functions.

198
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:13,240
I want you to know that you shouldn't confuse these two functions with its plural form.

199
00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:20,020
The plural form is used for pages with multiple posts, while the singular form is for single posts.

200
00:15:20,530 --> 00:15:24,400
Inside the template we have a section for the next and previous posts.

201
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:28,980
Search for the div tag with the class post dash navigation.

202
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:33,300
There should also be a comment right above the element that says page navigation.

203
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:38,230
Let's replace these static HTML links with their respective functions like so.

204
00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:48,960
Refresh the page and check if the links are working, WordPress will automatically generate these links

205
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,260
with the appropriate title.

206
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:51,840
That's it for now.

207
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:57,240
And the next lecture will finish up our template by adding comments and the form to submit additional

208
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:57,840
comments.
