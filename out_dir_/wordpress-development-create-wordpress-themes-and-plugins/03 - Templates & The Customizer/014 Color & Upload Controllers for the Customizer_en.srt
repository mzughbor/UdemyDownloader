1
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:13,250
Right now, I'm looking at the list of classes we can use for the controller, we've gone over how to

2
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:15,110
create a regular input field.

3
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:19,360
Now I want to show you how to use the color picker and upload controllers.

4
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:20,930
Here's what we're going to do.

5
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:27,440
I want to allow users to be able to change the color of these, read more links inside each post excerpt.

6
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:32,159
Then I want to allow them to upload a PDF report so their visitors can download it.

7
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:33,590
Let's get started.

8
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:36,320
Open the miscellaneous customizer function.

9
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:39,890
I've minimized a lot of the code in here, so it's easier to read.

10
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:43,040
As usual, the first step is create the settings.

11
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,290
The first setting will be called Jiyu.

12
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:49,790
Read more color with the default value of hash one a, b, c nine.

13
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:53,000
See this as the default color value for the links.

14
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:04,819
The next sitting will be Jiyu or file with a default value of an empty string.

15
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:15,670
The next step is to create a section, however, I plan on assigning the controllers under the Mesi

16
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:21,820
section so we can skip on to step three will start with the color controller at the very bottom called

17
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:23,290
the add control method.

18
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:30,780
Let's go back to the list of controller classes and view the color controller, as you can see, it's

19
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:32,500
not really complex to use at all.

20
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:38,550
I'm going to copy the code inside this controller and paste it into the add control method like so.

21
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:47,220
Let's go through this one by one, these parameters are exactly the same as the regular customizer controller.

22
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:52,210
The first parameter for this class is the WP customize object itself.

23
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:54,750
The second parameter is the ID.

24
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:57,070
I'm going to set this to J.

25
00:01:57,070 --> 00:01:59,050
You read more color input.

26
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:05,860
The label will be read more link color, which will also be translatable.

27
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,040
Then I'm going to set the section and settings key to their corresponding values.

28
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:22,690
Nothing really new so far, WordPress takes care of the rest, setting up the color picker.

29
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:25,710
I'm going to call the ad control method again.

30
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:36,350
This time, we're going to set up use the upload control class, go back to the list of classes, and

31
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:39,090
this time let's check out the upload control class.

32
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:43,140
Just like the color picker, the upload controller is also very simple.

33
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,350
I'm going to copy this code and paste it into our method.

34
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:54,490
The code is exactly the same as last time the WordPress team does a great job of making their customizer

35
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:55,610
classes consistent.

36
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:59,740
I'm going to set the ID to Jiyu report file input.

37
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:05,100
The label key will be set to file a report.

38
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:12,340
Then I'm going to set the section and settings key to their corresponding values.

39
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:23,900
Just like that, we now have the settings and controllers all set up, the next step is to have these

40
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:25,800
values reflected onto the theme.

41
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:30,600
Let's start with the read more color open the NQ function for the front end.

42
00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:34,460
I'm going to add my code right after where we NQ the files.

43
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,070
The color we have will be dynamic.

44
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:41,920
Dynamic success is kind of hard to pull off because of the solutions that are available.

45
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:44,380
There are two ways we can go about this.

46
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:50,930
The first solution would be to create a file that will output the dynamic success and change the headers.

47
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:54,290
The second solution would be to use inline styles.

48
00:03:54,830 --> 00:03:59,210
Both of these solutions are completely valid and I've seen developers use one or the other.

49
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:00,760
It is really up to you.

50
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:05,660
This is a really simple cyesis change, so I'm going to use inline styles.

51
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:08,060
It's quicker and easier to understand.

52
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:12,140
I'm going to call the function WP add inline style.

53
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:20,040
As the name suggests, this will load inline styles inside the head tag of the document.

54
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:25,610
The great thing about this function is that it will only load the inline styles if a particular file

55
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:26,300
is in cued.

56
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,140
You can specify that as the first parameter.

57
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:34,090
I only want to load these inline styles if the Jiyu custom file is loaded.

58
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:37,160
The second parameter is the CSF itself.

59
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:38,930
You input this as a string.

60
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:41,570
I'm going to paste in some simple S.O.S.

61
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:44,950
There's nothing really complex going on here.

62
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:51,010
All I'm doing is changing the color of the link and it's border using the dynamic color setting just

63
00:04:51,010 --> 00:04:53,330
like that, the read more link will be dynamic.

64
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:58,750
The last thing to do is to display the link to the downloadable report opened the footer file.

65
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:02,050
I'm going to add this code right after the copyright text.

66
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:04,330
Inside a conditional statement.

67
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:08,320
I'm going to check if the Mod Jiyu report file has a value.

68
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:20,270
The upload controller will set the value to the full http url to the file itself, it will take care

69
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:22,580
of uploading and processing the file for you.

70
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:28,910
With that said, if there is a file, then I want to output a simple Ancora link with the text download

71
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:29,350
report.

72
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:32,480
Make sure to add a brake tag afterwards.

73
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:45,130
That basically wraps it up, let's refresh the customizer and check if everything works by default,

74
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:49,900
the links should still be this green blue color and the download link in the footer should not appear.

75
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:54,650
Change the color to any color you want and then upload a file for the report.

76
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:58,760
In the resource section of this lecture, I provide a link to this report.

77
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:01,010
Feel free to download it and use it.

78
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:04,630
After making your changes, you should see everything work properly.

79
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:14,960
That's it for the customizer, it's a lot of code to write, but the process is very straightforward.

80
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:18,590
I highly encourage you to play with it more to get better at using it.
