1
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:12,000
The single template is finished, the header and footer are something we need to work on, but we'll

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:12,830
get to those later.

3
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,590
Right now, I want to focus on creating more templates.

4
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:22,950
As I stated before, the index template is the default template WordPress will load if any other template

5
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:23,690
is unavailable.

6
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:28,440
Let's examine the order of WordPress will use to determine what file to load.

7
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:33,100
WordPress will begin by looking for a custom template file.

8
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:38,820
You are free to create custom template files with custom names, but that's something we'll explore

9
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:39,710
in the future lecture.

10
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:45,870
If it doesn't find a custom template, then it'll begin searching for a template called Page, followed

11
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:47,590
by the slug of the page.

12
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:52,170
You can also use the ID, but that comes secondary to the slug.

13
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:59,850
Lastly, it'll search for the page singular and indexed template files in that order for this lecture

14
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:03,210
will be creating the page template.

15
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:09,450
To understand why we're going to create this template, let's view our site.

16
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:16,070
If I were to view the About US page, you'll notice that we have the same problem as single posts.

17
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:20,210
It's not exactly displayed how we would like it to be displayed.

18
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:25,990
Let's start creating the page template now from the template hierarchy page.

19
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:28,690
We have to name this file page dot BHP.

20
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:31,090
So let's create that file now.

21
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:37,630
I'm going to copy and paste the single template into the page template.

22
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:40,040
We're going to strip this down massively.

23
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:46,830
I'm going to remove the metadata tags, remove any links related to other posts and the post author

24
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:47,340
box.

25
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:07,810
What you'll end up having is the title content and the comments template.

26
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:10,770
Let's see what WordPress recommends for this template.

27
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:15,060
I'm in the theme development Codex page and I'm on the page.

28
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:17,850
P.S. I'll provide a link to that.

29
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:23,340
In the resource section of this lecture, WordPress recommends we display the title and content.

30
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:24,780
We're already doing that.

31
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:26,660
So let's move onto the next point.

32
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:33,450
Actually, we're already doing most of these, but bullet point five, number five recommends we add

33
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:34,380
an edit link.

34
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:38,810
But like last time, WordPress already provides this in the top bar.

35
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:41,720
So we've covered all bases we'd like to cover.

36
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:47,350
Let's open the HTML page template and see if we're missing anything from the original design.

37
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:52,440
If you take a look, you'll notice that there's one huge difference between this template and the page

38
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,360
we currently have.

39
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:59,580
That would be this big strip that contains the title will have to make a couple of modifications to

40
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:00,450
achieve this goal.

41
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:02,010
Switch back to the editor.

42
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:06,870
First, I'm going to remove this conditional statement that checks if there are posts.

43
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:18,780
The reason I'm removing it is because WordPress already checks if this page is actually available,

44
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:23,940
if a page does not exist, then WordPress will load the fall for templates.

45
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:26,320
So there's no need to make this check ourselves.

46
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:32,130
Next, I'm going to remove the title from its original position since it'll be called elsewhere.

47
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:40,820
Then I'm going to open the static HTML page template and look for that bar that displays the title.

48
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:45,780
It'll be these section tags surrounded by the page title comments.

49
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:48,030
I'm going to copy this in place.

50
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:50,290
This right after the header page like so.

51
00:03:57,050 --> 00:04:03,060
You'll notice right away we have a situation, our page titled HTML is outside of the loop.

52
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:05,120
There are two solutions for this.

53
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:11,590
We can either move the loop to encompass all this or we can repeat the loop in this situation.

54
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:14,940
I want to reuse the loop rather than move all the HTML.

55
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:18,950
So just like last time, I'm going to call another loop like this.

56
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:32,700
Then I'm going to move this section inside the loop and replace the title with the template, tag the

57
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:33,120
title.

58
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:42,290
I'm going to remove the title from Downbelow.

59
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:50,510
Next, we need to reset this loop, we've experienced multiple loops before, but those were two different

60
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:50,960
loops.

61
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:56,510
When you reuse the same loop, you need to reset the loop just like you would if you're using a different

62
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:56,830
loop.

63
00:04:57,170 --> 00:05:00,410
The function we have to call is called Rewind Post's.

64
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:06,440
In the resource section of this lecture, I provide a link to this function.

65
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:13,720
This is what WordPress says, rewind the loop posts in order to reuse the same query in different locations

66
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,350
on a page.

67
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:17,320
This is definitely the function we need.

68
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:20,700
The very last thing we need to do is add a subtitle.

69
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:24,540
However, there is no subtitle feature available in WordPress.

70
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,920
This leaves us with two options.

71
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:30,130
We either created ourselves or use a plugin.

72
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:32,520
We will be going with the second option.

73
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,190
A lot of developers will want to go with creating their own plugin.

74
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:41,590
But for something as simple as this, it would be best to just go with a third party solution and the

75
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:46,750
resource section of this lecture, I provide a link to a plugin called WP subtitle.

76
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:51,040
This plugin is super fast and simple to use in the description.

77
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:55,540
You'll notice the developer provides info on how to add this plug into your theme.

78
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:58,150
It's as simple as one line of code.

79
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:02,950
I'm going to go to the admin dashboard and navigate to plug ins, add new.

80
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:09,700
I'm going to search for a plugin called WP subtitle, then I'm going to install and activate it.

81
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:21,710
Once activated, you can now edit the about us page and you will see this newly created field called

82
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:25,640
subtitle, add a subtitle quickly and then say your changes.

83
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:33,830
To see the subtitle on the page, all we have to do is just copy and paste this one line of code onto

84
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:35,030
where we want it to appear.

85
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:38,060
I'm going to paste it into the tax.

86
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:46,380
Refresh the page and you should now see the subtitle up here before we declare this template finished,

87
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:47,760
we have to do one more thing.

88
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:54,950
If I deactivate this plugin, then we will throw an error because the subtitle function is undefined.

89
00:06:55,590 --> 00:07:00,870
I'm going to wrap this function in a conditional statement and use the function function exists and

90
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:01,950
pass in the function.

91
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:03,270
Name the subtitle.

92
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:19,520
This P function does add its name suggests if this function exists and we know that the WP subtitle

93
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:24,630
plugin is activated and this page may have a subtitle will then display it like so.

94
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:25,900
All right.

95
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:28,310
So that's one way to go about this.

96
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:30,410
But we can make this even more cleaner.

97
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:33,170
I haven't been completely honest with you.

98
00:07:33,450 --> 00:07:37,970
You don't have to create a loop like this to get the title outside of the post.

99
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,690
There's actually a template tag that does this.

100
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:44,440
I'm going to copy my HTML and paste it right above.

101
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:49,220
Then I'm going to replace the title function with single post title.

102
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:55,340
Since we have this function ready, then we can just remove the loop and the function rewind posts like

103
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:55,700
so.

104
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:09,600
This is much cleaner code wise, so if this function was available, why did I teach you how to recreate

105
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,050
the loop?

106
00:08:10,410 --> 00:08:13,890
In some situations you may need to create two loops.

107
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:17,440
I just wanted to show you an alternative solution to this problem.

108
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:19,620
Neither of these solutions are wrong.

109
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:20,840
It's just what you prefer.

110
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:25,000
If I refresh the page, then you should see both titles appear.

111
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:31,230
The subtitle also appears because the developer of the plugin has made it so that their template tag

112
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:33,730
function works in and outside of a loop.

113
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:38,880
I'm actually going to delete the Loopt solution and just keep this simpler version.

114
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:42,320
Like I said before, neither is the wrong solution.

115
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:43,980
It's just what you like best.

116
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,190
That wraps it up for this template.

117
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:48,900
Let's move on to creating more templates.
