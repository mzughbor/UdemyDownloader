WEBVTT

00:07.340 --> 00:09.210
We're almost done right now.

00:09.260 --> 00:10.470
I'm in the header file.

00:10.730 --> 00:13.590
We still have some static sections inside the template.

00:14.150 --> 00:15.860
First, let's tackle the title.

00:16.130 --> 00:19.670
WordPress provides two solutions for adding titles to your head.

00:20.110 --> 00:24.970
The first solution is a bit outdated, and that is by using the WP title function.

00:25.430 --> 00:29.920
This function is to be deprecated, but it is still available for backwards compatibility.

00:30.290 --> 00:31.820
I do not suggest using it.

00:32.030 --> 00:35.050
The recommended solution is to add theme support for it.

00:35.420 --> 00:40.520
I'm going to delete the title tags from the head tag and then open the setup file.

00:40.970 --> 00:45.260
I'm going to call the function, add theme support and pass entitled hash tag.

00:47.510 --> 00:54.020
Just like that, WordPress will always generate the title tag for you, any SEO plugins will also be

00:54.020 --> 00:56.060
able to make modifications if they wish.

00:56.630 --> 00:58.700
Next up is the logo itself.

00:59.000 --> 01:01.790
The logo can either be text or an image.

01:02.120 --> 01:03.980
Currently, we only have text.

01:04.190 --> 01:06.320
We are also willing to accept images.

01:06.560 --> 01:11.570
I'm going to call the function app theme support again and pass in custom dash logo.

01:13.840 --> 01:17.480
WordPress comes with a feature for users to upload their own logos.

01:17.890 --> 01:20.720
We don't have to make a form or handle the upload.

01:21.070 --> 01:23.180
You'll see how this works in just a moment.

01:23.800 --> 01:28.780
Go back to the header template and look for the div tag with the idea of logo.

01:29.140 --> 01:31.660
Inside this tag, add a conditional statement.

01:33.920 --> 01:39.200
To check if the user has uploaded a logo, you have to use the function, has a custom logo.

01:41.530 --> 01:47.130
This function will return true if the user uploaded a logo, otherwise it'll return false.

01:47.710 --> 01:51.700
If there is a logo, then we can call a function called the custom logo.

01:52.120 --> 01:55.720
This function will output the image along with a link to the homepage.

01:56.050 --> 02:00.720
In some situations, the user might not have a logo ready when they set up the theme.

02:01.150 --> 02:03.600
Whatever their reason, maybe you should have a backup.

02:04.210 --> 02:07.690
Let's add the else block and manually create a link.

02:08.030 --> 02:10.810
I'm going to use the static version as a template.

02:16.780 --> 02:22.300
I'm going to replace the link and echo out the value returned by the function home yourself.

02:22.780 --> 02:28.090
I'm going to pass in a forward slash so we can specify that we only want the root you out.

02:30.640 --> 02:34.210
Inside the tanks, I'm going to call the blog info function.

02:36.350 --> 02:41.810
This function takes in a string, which is what pieces of information about the blog we want in the

02:41.810 --> 02:46.980
resource section of this lecture, I provide a link to more info about this function here.

02:47.030 --> 02:53.630
You'll find a list of values you can pass in the very first one is name, which returns the name of

02:53.630 --> 02:54.060
the site.

02:54.440 --> 02:55.820
So let's pass that in.

02:58.020 --> 03:03.990
This function will automatically output the value, if you ever want the value returned, then you just

03:03.990 --> 03:06.210
use the get block info function.

03:06.390 --> 03:09.800
Let's refresh the page and check if everything is working so far.

03:10.080 --> 03:13.280
If you look at the title, you'll notice it updates accordingly.

03:13.650 --> 03:19.980
The logo is also showing our text to change the logo to an image you need to click this button called

03:19.980 --> 03:20.850
Customize.

03:21.330 --> 03:26.850
This will take you to the customizer, which is a way to edit your site while also viewing the changes

03:26.850 --> 03:29.610
in real time under site identity.

03:29.640 --> 03:31.900
You will find the form for updating the logo.

03:32.520 --> 03:35.470
I don't have a logo image, so I will leave this alone.

03:35.820 --> 03:39.930
The next two things I want to do is update the menu and fix this advertising spot.

03:40.620 --> 03:43.770
Before I do that, I want to talk about this customizer.

03:43.980 --> 03:49.170
In the past, the WordPress customizer was really hard to work with and did not have as much features.

03:49.500 --> 03:54.330
This may developers make their own settings and options page to change how the theme functions.

03:54.870 --> 04:00.630
However, in recent updates, the customizer is starting to become the main way to modify a theme.

04:01.080 --> 04:04.350
A lot of theme developers are opting to use the customizer.

04:04.710 --> 04:07.610
We will definitely be working with the customizer soon.

04:08.540 --> 04:15.680
For now, let's focus on this secondary menu on the top, we've already created a menu before, so try

04:15.680 --> 04:17.270
creating another one yourself.

04:18.800 --> 04:21.750
If you aren't able to do it, then let's try it together.

04:22.070 --> 04:26.030
I'm not going to go over every detail so will fly by this quickly.

04:26.690 --> 04:31.310
First in the setup function, use the registered NAV menu function.

04:33.570 --> 04:38.820
I'm going to reuse the previous code and replace these values with the word secondary like so.

04:40.990 --> 04:43.310
With the menu registered, we can now display it.

04:43.600 --> 04:49.420
I'm going to go into the admin dashboard and create a new menu and assign it to the secondary location.

04:54.760 --> 05:00.280
Inside the header template, I'm going to copy and paste the last menu into the other menu spot.

05:08.280 --> 05:14.340
I'm going to replace these two values with the secondary menu and then set the depth to one, since

05:14.340 --> 05:16.910
I don't want drop downs for the secondary menu.

05:19.280 --> 05:25.760
Refresh the page and you should now see the secondary menu being displayed so far, everything is really

05:25.760 --> 05:26.430
coming together.

05:27.230 --> 05:30.770
This ad spot has been broken for some time, so let's fix that.

05:31.160 --> 05:36.680
Previously, we used the plug in WP subtitle to add subtitles to our posts.

05:36.980 --> 05:40.700
We will be doing something similar to this and the resource section.

05:40.700 --> 05:47.410
I provide a link to the WP Quad's plug this plug and handles advertisement for WordPress sites.

05:47.630 --> 05:50.300
It's a really great plug in that is updated constantly.

05:50.660 --> 05:53.000
The best part is that it's developer friendly.

05:53.330 --> 05:57.680
We can create our own custom ad spots and have it managed by this plug in.

05:58.100 --> 06:01.150
This frees us from having to handle all the logic ourselves.

06:01.730 --> 06:05.930
I want you to install and activate this plug in through the admin dashboard.

06:11.710 --> 06:16.460
After doing so, look inside the WP dash contents plugins folder.

06:16.780 --> 06:19.140
This is where all your plug ins are installed.

06:19.480 --> 06:23.050
The quick dash ad sense Dash Reloaded plug in is the plug.

06:23.050 --> 06:28.180
And we just installed open the includes API file.

06:28.870 --> 06:33.850
You'll notice in these comments, the developer left notes on how to integrate this plug in into your

06:33.850 --> 06:34.180
theme.

06:34.660 --> 06:36.490
There are two steps you need to do.

06:36.820 --> 06:41.700
The first step is to tell WP Quad's that you have a custom ad spot and your theme.

06:42.280 --> 06:45.850
The second step would be to instruct it where to display the ad spot.

06:46.600 --> 06:51.080
I'm going to register this ad spot in the setup function instead of the functions file.

06:51.610 --> 06:56.720
The reason I'm doing this is because the setup function is called right after our theme has been loaded.

06:57.280 --> 07:02.620
Therefore, I know nothing has been officially processed unless it was put in the function file.

07:02.920 --> 07:04.840
So it's technically the same thing.

07:05.590 --> 07:08.110
The only difference is that it's in separate files.

07:08.380 --> 07:10.890
This makes our code look a whole lot cleaner.

07:11.200 --> 07:15.160
I'm going to copy and paste the commented code into this function like so.

07:17.430 --> 07:21.860
I'm only going to have one spot, you'll see that this code does two things.

07:22.500 --> 07:29.180
First, we use a conditional statement to check if the Function Quad's Register ad exists this way.

07:29.220 --> 07:32.310
We know that the WP Quad's plug in is activated.

07:32.910 --> 07:37.550
Then we call the Function Quad's Register ad, which has two parameters.

07:37.860 --> 07:40.530
The first is the idea of the location.

07:40.920 --> 07:45.840
I'm going to call this Udemy header and for the description it will be Udemy header position.

07:48.020 --> 07:54.710
With this in place, questions will now know we have an ad spot inside the admin dashboard, you'll

07:54.710 --> 07:59.280
find the WP Quad's menu under the ad code section.

07:59.300 --> 08:01.310
I'm going to paste in an image tag.

08:07.070 --> 08:13.340
The image that I'm using is from a site called Placeholder It, I'll provide a link to this image.

08:13.610 --> 08:18.740
This site allows you to modify the size of the image and create a temporary placeholder.

08:19.130 --> 08:20.900
This is really great for web development.

08:23.190 --> 08:26.230
Save the changes and then switch to the position tab.

08:26.550 --> 08:29.870
You'll notice that our new position is showing up at the very bottom.

08:30.480 --> 08:33.820
Activate this position and assign it to the first ad we created.

08:34.230 --> 08:35.850
Make sure to save your changes.

08:38.080 --> 08:44.290
Our ad is ready, and now all we have to do is display it inside the header template, look for the

08:44.290 --> 08:50.770
div tag with the class top dash advert, add a conditional statement that checks for the function Quad's

08:50.770 --> 08:51.130
at.

08:56.260 --> 09:02.470
Then I'm going to call this function and pass an array with the key location, the name of the location

09:02.470 --> 09:06.070
will be the location you passed into the Quad's Register ad function.

09:08.190 --> 09:13.620
This function will return the HTML we passed in previously, so we have to echo it out.

09:15.850 --> 09:16.400
That's it.

09:16.690 --> 09:22.570
Let's check if our ad appears appropriately, just like that, we now have ads on our site with custom

09:22.570 --> 09:23.350
locations.

09:23.650 --> 09:26.960
This plug in is amazing and it takes care of managing ads.

09:27.280 --> 09:29.760
This is the second plugin we've used in our theme.

09:30.460 --> 09:34.300
It's extremely common for theme developers to bundle their themes with plug ins.

09:34.600 --> 09:38.280
This increases the value of your theme in a future lecture.

09:38.320 --> 09:41.660
I will go over how you can bundle plug ins with your theme properly.

09:42.340 --> 09:47.650
The reason I'm not showing you now is because I don't want to have to constantly update multiple files

09:47.650 --> 09:48.850
whenever we add a plug in.

09:49.240 --> 09:52.980
I would rather knock it out all at once when our theme is nearly finished.

09:53.560 --> 09:58.910
For now, we will continue working on the header and eventually move to the footer on the header.

09:58.960 --> 10:02.250
We have these social icons for these icons.

10:02.260 --> 10:04.630
We will be using the word press customizer.

10:04.930 --> 10:08.870
This will introduce us to how the customizer works and how to extend it.

10:09.580 --> 10:11.320
I do want to give you a warning.

10:11.560 --> 10:17.290
So far we've really just been calling functions and using WordPress as templating system to handle a

10:17.290 --> 10:18.550
lot of the logic for us.

10:19.210 --> 10:24.910
WordPress will still help us with extending the customizer, but we will be writing a lot more code

10:24.910 --> 10:28.750
and be focusing more on the code rather than the visual aspect.

10:29.020 --> 10:35.080
The customizer can seem overwhelming, but I promise you we will be using it constantly so you will

10:35.080 --> 10:36.280
get used to it eventually.

10:36.850 --> 10:40.310
I highly recommend you take a break before moving on to the next lecture.

10:40.600 --> 10:41.230
See you there.
