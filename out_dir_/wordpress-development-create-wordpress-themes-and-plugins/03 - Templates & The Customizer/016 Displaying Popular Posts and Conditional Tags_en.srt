1
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:13,620
One section we haven't gotten around to is this breaking news, which is keeping track of popular posts

2
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:16,600
can be tedious and it's not exactly built into WordPress.

3
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:20,320
Luckily, there is a plugin out there that will help us out with that.

4
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:24,960
I want you to go to the admin dashboard and add a new plug in the plug.

5
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,090
And I want to install is called WordPress.

6
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:30,840
Popular posts install and activate the one by Hektor.

7
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:36,180
This plugin will automatically help us keep track of what posts are popular by Vieux.

8
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:46,530
Under settings, you'll find a menu item called WordPress Popular posts here you can control what posts

9
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:48,720
are popular and additional settings.

10
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:51,380
We don't need to make any changes at this moment.

11
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:53,940
Right now, none of the posts are popular.

12
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:58,650
I'm going to open the homepage within a new tab and view at least three posts.

13
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:00,330
I want you to do the same.

14
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:07,850
Refresh the admin page after you've done so, and you'll now see those three posts being displayed as

15
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:08,780
popular posts.

16
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:09,700
This is great.

17
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:12,850
So far there are now two things we need to do.

18
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:18,410
We need to display the popular posts and then we need to let the user control whether or not they want

19
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:20,330
to display it while we're at it.

20
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:23,770
We will also make the text breaking news changeable.

21
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:30,530
First, let's display these posts inside the WordPress Popular Posts admin page.

22
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:32,750
I'm going to click on the Parameters tab.

23
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:37,070
This plugin allows you to display the popular posts two ways.

24
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:40,790
One way is through a shortcode and the other is through a template tag.

25
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:43,070
I want to use the template tag.

26
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:46,670
You'll find a list of parameters we can set to modify the output.

27
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:48,410
We'll be using these shortly.

28
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:50,990
Inside the index template.

29
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:54,650
I want you to perform a conditional check around the popular post widget.

30
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:09,780
I want to check for two things I want to check of the page being displayed is not a single post and

31
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:11,730
is the home page using the functions?

32
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:14,730
Exclamation point is single and is home.

33
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:22,680
These two functions are at work, press calls, conditional tags, conditional tags or a way to check

34
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:27,870
what kind of page is being displayed in the resource section, I provide a link to learn more about

35
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:28,900
conditional tags.

36
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:31,440
Here is what WordPress has to say about it.

37
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:37,500
Conditional tags can be used in your template files to alter the display of content depending on the

38
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,630
conditions that the current page matches.

39
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,040
They tell WordPress what code to display under specific conditions.

40
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:49,020
Conditional tags usually work with P, if else, conditional statements.

41
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:53,190
The code begins by checking to see if a statement is true or false.

42
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:57,210
If the statement is found to be true, the first set of code is executed.

43
00:02:57,570 --> 00:03:03,570
If it's false, the first set of code is skipped and the second set of code after the else is executed

44
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:04,020
and set.

45
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:09,900
You can read up on this page to learn about the many conditional tags there are, but for now, the

46
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:12,240
ones we're using will suffice throughout.

47
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:16,210
This course will be using conditional tags to help us change the final result.

48
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:17,190
All right.

49
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:22,500
Now that we know that this is indeed the home page, we can begin displaying the breaking news widget.

50
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:28,110
I'm also going to check if the WP get most popular function exists.

51
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:38,230
We can now call a function called WP get most popular.

52
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:46,240
This function has a one parameter and that is an array of settings we can set back on the admin side,

53
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:52,100
you'll find that the plug in WordPress popular posts gives plenty of examples on how to use these settings.

54
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:56,300
There are only three that I want to use and those can be found at the very bottom.

55
00:03:57,050 --> 00:04:00,530
These last three keys determine how the posts are outputting.

56
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:03,980
The first key we should set is the WP start.

57
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:17,089
This will be the HTML that will be outputted at the very beginning, we have the static version of widget

58
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:17,470
here.

59
00:04:17,829 --> 00:04:22,960
I'm going to copy everything from the beginning all the way up to the opening tag with the class of

60
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,170
slider dash wrap.

61
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:26,800
I'm going to paste this in as the value.

62
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:34,780
The next key I want to set is the WP, and this should have all the closing tags.

63
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:44,580
The only thing we have left are these three links, we only need one, so I'm just going to cut one

64
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:45,700
and get rid of the rest.

65
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:49,260
The last key to set is the post HTML.

66
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:53,250
This key value will be the HTML we just cut previously.

67
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:05,910
Now we have to replace the static parts of this HTML into something like the function will be able to

68
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:06,990
read and replace.

69
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:12,450
If you look at the documentation, you'll find that the developer provides you with what values can

70
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:13,830
be inserted and replaced.

71
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:19,650
The only ones we're concerned with are the normal and text underscore title content tags.

72
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:25,770
We just replace the static content with these content tags, make sure to surround them with one pair

73
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:28,770
of curly brackets so that the plugin will be able to replace the.

74
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:39,870
Let's refresh the page and you'll see the three posts we previously viewed being displayed as popular

75
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:44,790
posts, the last thing we need to do is to make it optional to display this widget or not.

76
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:50,430
Inside the miscellaneous customizer, I'm going to create two new settings.

77
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:56,580
The first setting is called Jiyu Shohet or popular post widget, which will have a default value of

78
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:57,110
false.

79
00:05:57,510 --> 00:06:00,060
I don't want this widget to be turned on by default.

80
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:14,280
The second setting will be Jiyu popular posts, which at title, which will have a default title of

81
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,210
breaking news.

82
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:24,810
The next step is to create a controller.

83
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:30,980
I'm going to assign these two controllers to the MEAC section, the first controller will be a checkbox

84
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:34,520
with an ID of Jiyu show header, popular posts.

85
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:35,390
Which widget input?

86
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:54,600
The second controller will just be a text input field with an ID of Jiyu, popular posts, widget title

87
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,020
input.

88
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:09,480
There's nothing new here after creating these two settings and it's comptrollers, it's time to update

89
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,340
the theme to reflect those changes.

90
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:15,510
Back inside the conditional statement, I'm going to add one more check.

91
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:21,810
This will be checking if the theme mod Jiyu show had popular post widget is turned on.

92
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:31,750
The last thing I'm going to do is change the breaking news static text into its theme, Monju popular

93
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:32,920
post widget title.

94
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:43,240
Save your changes and let's check out the customizer, the checkbox should be unchecked, and so therefore

95
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:45,850
the popular post widget should not be showing.

96
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:49,810
Try turning it on and then change the text to popular posts.

97
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:54,970
After confirming if everything worked on the preview, then save your changes and double check on the

98
00:07:54,970 --> 00:07:55,400
front end.

99
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:56,980
That's it for now.

100
00:07:57,100 --> 00:08:02,190
You'll notice that I spent an awful lot of time talking about other plugins and how to integrate them.

101
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:05,430
I'm going to show you something in the resources section.

102
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:09,610
I provide a link to the theme for a site under WordPress.

103
00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:10,630
Popular themes.

104
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:14,600
You'll notice a lot of themes are killing it and making massive amounts of sales.

105
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:19,870
I'm going to click on Aveda and you'll notice that this item highlights it's compatible with various

106
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:22,240
plugins and even comes bundled with some.

107
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:27,670
It's extremely common to bundle your themes with plugins that help it with certain tasks and functions.

108
00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:33,429
Of course, you'll be put in a situation where you'll have to make your own custom solution and we'll

109
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:35,750
definitely learn how to make plug in soon.

110
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:41,830
For now, don't worry, bundling plug ins doesn't make you a bad developer, just a more efficient one.
