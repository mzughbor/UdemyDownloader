1
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:09,720
Creating the search template is fairly easy.

2
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:13,600
I'm still in a theme development Codex page on the sidebar.

3
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:14,570
Click on Search.

4
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:18,550
You'll see what WordPress recommends for this template.

5
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:25,110
Basically, it just says we need to include results and a search form with the search query if a user

6
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:25,810
inputted one.

7
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:27,480
First things first.

8
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:28,770
Let's create this file.

9
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:36,400
I'm going to be using the code from the index template, I'm going to remove the breaking news widget

10
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:37,830
before I do anything else.

11
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:46,810
Then open the static search template.

12
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:49,290
There are a few components that we need to add.

13
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:51,840
The first is the page title bar.

14
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:53,100
So add that right now.

15
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:03,720
The next thing the setup is the search for him right above the posts, inside the search template,

16
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:06,030
you'll find a section called Search Box.

17
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:10,640
Copy everything between these two comments and pasted inside the search template.

18
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,390
It should be placed inside the div tag with the class post content.

19
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:23,530
With both components added, let's convert them into dynamic code back to the search template right

20
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:27,890
above the loop, we already have a search form and so it would make sense to reuse it.

21
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:31,780
I'm going to replace this form with the get search form function.

22
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:39,560
For the title, I'm going to make this part of the text translatable and echo it out with the underscore

23
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:40,250
E function.

24
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:49,870
After that, I'm going to call the function, the search query, this function will output the text

25
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:51,040
the user searched for.

26
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:56,470
Lastly, I'm going to make this text translatable.

27
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:05,290
I'm going to go back to the homepage now, we can try and search for something and we should see some

28
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:05,860
results.

29
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:13,300
Keep in mind that our posts are created using Fagre Press, which uses a lorem if some generator, regular

30
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:19,840
English words won't work unless your posts actually contain English words, the search template should

31
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,110
be working without a problem.

32
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,850
We can begin working on custom templates.

33
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:29,860
There are some situations where we want to make custom templates for pages, posts and any other post

34
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:30,340
types.

35
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:33,760
For example, let's take a look at the About US page.

36
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:38,050
This page contains our content on the left and the sidebar on the right.

37
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:41,830
A lot of themes out there provide the option to make this full width.

38
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,350
There are two ways we can replicate this.

39
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:49,710
We can cut up our own logic and then perform checks to see if the user wants a full with page.

40
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:54,940
The second option is we can take advantage of WordPress custom templates feature.

41
00:02:55,240 --> 00:03:00,490
I don't know about you, but I think the custom template route seems simpler and it actually is.

42
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:02,140
Let's see how this works.

43
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:07,900
I'm going to create a file called Full Dash with Dash Page Dot BHP.

44
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:12,700
Unlike WordPress templates, you can name your custom template files, whatever you want.

45
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:15,540
I could have called this fire truck if I wanted to.

46
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:21,250
Next, I'm going to copy the contents of the page template into this custom template.

47
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:29,260
Then I'm going to remove the sidebar from this template and remove this div tag with the class post

48
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:29,770
content.

49
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:32,590
I'm not going to remove what's inside.

50
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:35,110
Only the opening and closing tag itself.

51
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:47,520
So now the question is, how do we make WordPress recognize this as a custom template?

52
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:50,980
Well, it's simple at the very top of the file.

53
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:52,730
We're going to add a file header.

54
00:03:53,490 --> 00:03:55,610
Do you remember how we make file headers?

55
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:57,090
We use block comments.

56
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,370
Let's create a block comment now.

57
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:03,810
Add the following text template name, column for Web page.

58
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:11,280
We have to pass in the words template name, followed by the name of the template, you can name it

59
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,930
whatever you want, but it's good practice to keep it short and concise.

60
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:18,740
Go back to your browser and try editing the About US page.

61
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:22,680
If you look on the side, you'll see an option to select a template.

62
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:27,680
WordPress automatically finds our custom templates and we can select it as an option.

63
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:32,450
So let's select the full width page template and save our changes.

64
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:36,360
If you look at the page now, you'll see it's completely full width.

65
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:39,630
We didn't have to code any logic whatsoever.

66
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:44,940
WordPress took care of checking our theme for custom templates and handling which template to load.

67
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:49,700
The more you use WordPress, the more you'll find out how powerful it actually is.

68
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,460
Now, let's say I want to have a full with post.

69
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:56,250
Let's try viewing a post and then editing it.

70
00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:04,760
You'll notice that we don't have that template option available, this is because by default, WordPress

71
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:08,200
will only allow custom templates to be enabled for pages only.

72
00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:12,740
It's very simple to make custom templates available for any post type you want.

73
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:18,580
In the resource section of this lecture, I provide a link to the page template handbook.

74
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:22,550
This whole page talks about how to work with custom templates.

75
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:28,910
But the one section I want you to focus on is the creating page templates for specific post types.

76
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:35,420
WordPress shows us in the example that in order to make a template available for other post types,

77
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:40,250
you have to add the template post type setting followed by the name of the post type.

78
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:46,250
Before you make a template for posts, I want you to notice one thing, and that is this warning right

79
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:47,360
below the example.

80
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:53,600
It states that custom templates for post types other than pages has only been available since version

81
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,450
four point seven.

82
00:05:55,010 --> 00:05:56,900
This is very important to note.

83
00:05:56,900 --> 00:06:02,460
If you ever work on a theme on a WordPress version earlier than four point seven, let's get started.

84
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:07,670
I will not be using the full dash with dash page template as before with post template.

85
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:13,610
This is because this template is based on the original page template, which is really just a stripped

86
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:15,520
down version of the single post template.

87
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:19,190
I want to have all the features of the single post template.

88
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:25,510
Without the sidebar, I'm going to create a new file named for Dash with Dash Post P.

89
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:34,880
Copy the contents from the single template into this newly created file, unlike last time, I'm going

90
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:41,510
to remove the sidebar and remove the div tags with the clasp post content, just the opening and closing

91
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:43,250
tags, nothing in between.

92
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:55,850
At the very top, create a new file header set the template name has full width post and add the other

93
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:58,910
part template post type with the value of post.

94
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,940
This file with template will only be four posts.

95
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:04,580
It will not be made available for pages.

96
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:12,170
Try editing the post and you'll find the template available for use, save your changes and view the

97
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:12,620
post.

98
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:19,080
That's it for custom templates.

99
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:22,270
Be sure to read up on this link I provided earlier.

100
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:24,720
