00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:12,730
WordPress provides a set of notices that we can use to display warnings or success messages.

2
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:16,900
We could just use our own bootstrap classes, but I don't want to use them.

3
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:21,730
This is because I plan on making the notices appear on most admin pages.

4
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:26,240
However, I don't want to load bootstrap classes just to display messages.

5
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:29,590
It's better to just use the word press stylings for this.

6
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:32,240
It's not hard to pull off, so let's get started.

7
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:39,360
I want to display notices to the admin if there are more than five pending recipes inside the main plugin

8
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:39,850
file.

9
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:42,570
Let's have the action hook admin notices.

10
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:52,310
This event will trigger when the admin notices begin loading, so we want to load ours to the function

11
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:54,560
will be called our admin notices.

12
00:00:57,080 --> 00:01:04,280
Create a file inside the includes admin folder named Notice, stop defining the function here and make

13
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:05,180
sure to include it.

14
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:19,130
Inside this function, we're going to output a div tag with the classes, notice, notice the warning.

15
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:20,510
Is Dasch dismissable?

16
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:35,090
I'm also going to give it the ID of Ardeche recipe dash pending dash notice.

17
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:43,230
I'm going to insert a P tag for formatting reasons, and inside it, I'm going to output the message.

18
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:46,230
You have a couple of recipes waiting to be reviewed.

19
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,750
I'm also going to make this translatable.

20
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:59,210
This is the very basics of creating an admin notice, the only things worth highlighting is the class

21
00:01:59,210 --> 00:01:59,690
names.

22
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:04,820
The notice class is required to have WordPress format and space to notice for you.

23
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:09,120
The notice dash warning class will determine the color of the class.

24
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:16,310
There are four classes you can use to change the colors, which are the notice info, notice Dasch success,

25
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:19,970
notice Stasch warning and notice Dasch error classes.

26
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:21,110
And this example.

27
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:23,920
We're using the warning version which gives us the color yellow.

28
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,720
The last class is the is dash dismissable class.

29
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:32,960
This class will add a little close button to the far right, which will allow the user to close this

30
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:33,460
notice.

31
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:36,800
Let's refresh the admin page and see if everything works.

32
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:39,680
As you can see, the notice is now displaying.

33
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:43,850
The only problem is that this notice is displaying on every page load.

34
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:49,280
Even if we were to click on the close button, it'll only disappear on that current page load.

35
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:52,580
If we refresh the page again, you'll see it reappears.

36
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:55,970
WordPress doesn't take care of managing notices for you.

37
00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:58,240
It all has to be done manually by you.

38
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:00,650
Luckily, the process is very simple.

39
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:05,210
I'm going to create an option that will determine whether or not to display the notice.

40
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:11,720
The best place to put this is inside the submit dash user dash recipe file.

41
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:19,640
I only want this code to apply to this file because all posts submitted on the front end are automatically

42
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:21,950
set to pending open this file.

43
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:25,660
And right before we output the response, we're going to place the code here.

44
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:29,630
I'm going to add a comment so that it can be easier to read this file.

45
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:40,680
Right before we define the variables, I'm going to include the WP DB variable so that we can make a

46
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:43,010
query to grab how many posts are pending.

47
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:48,710
Then back up this spot, I'm going to create a variable named pending recipe count.

48
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,050
I'm going to set this to the value returned by the method.

49
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:55,050
Get Vare of the WP DB Object.

50
00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:05,170
Here is the query I'm going to make select count from WP posts where posts underscore status equals

51
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:08,290
pending and post underscore type equals recipe.

52
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:24,630
This query is very straightforward, I'm counting how many posts are inside the post database table

53
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:30,210
and filtering the results, who only include the posts that are pending approval and that the post type

54
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:30,950
is recipe.

55
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:36,810
After this, I'm going to create a conditional statement that will check if the number is greater than

56
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:38,070
or equal to five.

57
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:47,180
If this returns true, then I'm going to call the update option function, this function will automatically

58
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:49,190
create the option if it doesn't exist.

59
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:53,540
So that's why we're using the update version instead of using the ad version.

60
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:57,110
The option I want to add will be called our pending recipe.

61
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,120
Notice the value will be one.

62
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:04,400
One will mean there are recipes pending and zero will mean there are no recipes pending.

63
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:05,600
Just like that.

64
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:10,390
We've added an option only if there are currently more than five recipes pending approval.

65
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:13,310
The next step is to update the notice function.

66
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:17,150
To check for this value, I'm going to add a conditional statement.

67
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:21,650
I'm simply going to check the value returned by the get option function.

68
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:33,480
We just passed it and the option we created earlier, I'm going to check if this returns false, if

69
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:37,860
it does, then we'll just return the function, preventing the notice from displaying.

70
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:45,520
The very last step to all of this is to remove the notice if the user clicks on the closed button,

71
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:49,910
if we don't, then the notice will appear permanently, which we don't want.

72
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:52,820
We'll need the help of JavaScript to accomplish this.

73
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:58,940
Inside the assets logs folder, open the admin Dasch Global Dodgiest file.

74
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:02,210
I've already provided the code for you to speed things up.

75
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:06,430
As the name suggests, this file will be loaded on every admin page.

76
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:10,810
This file should only have code that you'd want to load on every admin page.

77
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:13,820
You don't want to bloat a user's admin dashboard.

78
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:17,810
All I'm doing here is listening for a click on the Dismas button.

79
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:20,780
If it's clicked, then I'll make an action request.

80
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:25,700
I won't be sending data besides the action name, since this will be a pretty simple function.

81
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:32,180
The name of the action is are dismissed pending recipe notice inside the main plug and file.

82
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:35,450
At this hook, the name of the function will be the same name.

83
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:49,880
Then create a file inside the process folder called Remove Dash Noticed and define the function here,

84
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:51,860
make sure to include it as well.

85
00:06:55,910 --> 00:07:00,710
All we will do is update the option, our pending recipe notice to zero.

86
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:07,520
That should do it, let's test to see if everything works.

87
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:11,580
I'm going to submit a little over five recipes from the front end publisher.

88
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:12,710
All right.

89
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:15,560
As you can see, I have five pending recipes.

90
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:18,170
If you look at the top, you'll see the notice appearing hearing.

91
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:21,050
I'm going to remove this notice and it should disappear.

92
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:27,790
If I refresh the page, then it should still be gone just like that, we've added a nice little notice

93
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:29,050
on the admin dashboard.
