00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:13,280
In this lecture will be exploring image cropping and image sciences, WordPress makes it easy to crop

2
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:17,620
images without having to download or use any external third party libraries.

3
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:22,670
If we take a look at our posts on the homepage, you'll see our images fitting nice and tight.

4
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:26,990
However, just like Buddy Press, the images may be bigger than they should be.

5
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:30,440
Inspect the element and check the sizes of the images.

6
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:38,090
Inside this little preview box, you'll see the science that's on the page and the natural size of the

7
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:44,420
image, we want the natural size and size on the page to be as close as they can be to save on bandwidth.

8
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:48,110
To do this, we have to register the image size we desire.

9
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:54,050
In the resource section of this lecture, I provide a link to a function called Add Image Signs.

10
00:00:54,410 --> 00:00:59,660
This function allows you to add a custom image size that WordPress will use whenever a new image is

11
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:01,220
uploaded by default.

12
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:07,190
WordPress has some built in image sizes, such as the thumbnail size, which is a size we've used before.

13
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:09,550
Inside the setup function.

14
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:11,120
We're going to call this function.

15
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:15,110
I'm going to add this code right after the themes support functions.

16
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:16,850
Let's call this function now.

17
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:20,660
And the first parameter is the name of this size any name will do.

18
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:22,700
I'm going to set this to J.

19
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:23,960
You dash post.

20
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:24,860
Dash image.

21
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:31,110
The second and third parameters are the width and height, respectively.

22
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:34,570
These are values you'll have to test out through trial and error.

23
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:37,730
The sizes I like are 860 by five.

24
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:38,510
Seventy five.

25
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:47,440
The last parameter is whether we want a soft crop or a hard crop, if you're unfamiliar with soft or

26
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:51,800
hard cropping, then check out the link I have in the resource section of this lecture.

27
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:56,130
This is a very long article that goes over image cropping and WordPress.

28
00:01:56,410 --> 00:02:01,120
It's definitely worth reading, but I'm going to give you a quick rundown on what you need to know.

29
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:05,440
If you scroll down a bit, you'll come across these two images from the author.

30
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:08,979
These two images are full sized and not cropped at all.

31
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:15,520
By default, WordPress will set the fourth parameter to false meaning that images are soft cropped.

32
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,660
If you scroll down further, you'll come across the images resize.

33
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:25,120
As you can see, the images are not exactly the desired size the author wanted them to be.

34
00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:28,690
The size the author put down is two hundred by two hundred.

35
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:32,100
So technically these images should be squares, but they're not.

36
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:35,440
This is what WordPress calls soft cropping.

37
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:38,290
WordPress will resize an image to the dimensions.

38
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:44,950
You specify, however, if the ratio of the images cannot be kept intact, it will then resize the image

39
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:50,590
to as close as to the dimensions you inputted without having to crop any piece of the image or distorting

40
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:50,740
it.

41
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,170
The next type of cropping is hard.

42
00:02:53,170 --> 00:02:57,780
Croppy, harder cropping will resize an image to the exact dimensions you input it.

43
00:02:58,150 --> 00:03:03,460
However, if an image begins to look distorted, it'll cropped the image to prevent any distortion.

44
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:06,310
So you're only getting a piece of that image.

45
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:08,890
If you scroll down, you'll see how that's done.

46
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:10,330
You just pass in.

47
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:13,450
True, and WordPress will cropped the image from the center.

48
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:18,970
If you're not looking for a centering position, you can configure the fourth parameter as an array

49
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:21,520
and specify where you'd like the cropping to begin.

50
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,770
If you scroll down the examples, you'll see the many ways images can be hard cropped.

51
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:29,830
So that's basically this article in a nutshell.

52
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:34,210
After this lecture is over, I highly encourage you to give it a good read.

53
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:35,380
All right.

54
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:39,850
So I'm going to set my fourth parameter to false as I want solved cropping.

55
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:46,450
I prefer my whole image viewable without any cropping the size maybe off than what I desired, but I'm

56
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:47,140
fine with that.

57
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:50,740
Usually the size difference is only by a few pixels.

58
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:56,410
I'd rather have an image off by a few pixels than have an image off by a hundred or even a thousand

59
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:56,980
pixels.

60
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:01,900
Now that our image size is registered, we can begin to use it in our own theme.

61
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:05,200
Open the content dash excerpt template.

62
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:05,890
Part file.

63
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:14,370
Look for where we outputted the featured image previously, we set this to for I'm going to replace

64
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:19,500
this with our custom image size and set this to Jiyu dash post dash image.

65
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:24,400
Refresh the home page and expect the element.

66
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:32,700
The signs may or may not be exactly the sizes we specified, but it's pretty close.

67
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:38,780
I'm going to open the single Templar file and do the same since the width of the post is the same as

68
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:39,520
the home page.

69
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:43,220
Look for where we outputted the thumbnail and use the custom size.

70
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:54,820
Having your own image size is great, but this will not always work.

71
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:59,520
Some users who install theme may be installing it on an existing WordPress site.

72
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:03,390
If they have existing images, they may not all be resized.

73
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:06,620
Only new images are resized and some old ones.

74
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:12,000
In this case, we have to force all images to be resized to prevent any problems.

75
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:18,000
Luckily, there's a plug and that does this go to the admin dashboard and navigate to plugins, add

76
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:18,350
new.

77
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:24,270
Then I want you to look for the plug and regenerate thumbnails, install and activate this plugin.

78
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:35,180
After installing this plugin, go to Tool's region thumbnails, the plugin will go through all the images

79
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:40,220
uploaded through WordPress and resize them all for you using the default settings and your own custom

80
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:40,820
sizes.

81
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:46,850
If a plugin also registers a size, it'll also resize the images according to that size.

82
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:49,010
All you have to do is click this button.

83
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:52,500
This may take a while, especially if you have a lot of images.

84
00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:53,710
Just be patient.

85
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:09,640
After all the images have been resized, we are assured that our image size has been applied to all

86
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:10,690
images on the site.

87
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:16,570
This is a plug and we are going to recommend to the user when they install our theme will be going over

88
00:06:16,570 --> 00:06:21,220
a how to bundle all the plug ins we installed so far with our theme in a future lecture.
