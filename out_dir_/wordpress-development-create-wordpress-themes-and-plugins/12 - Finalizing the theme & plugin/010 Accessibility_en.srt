1
00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:13,060
One of the best things you could do is make your site accessible to people with disabilities, accessibility

2
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:17,720
is a pretty huge topic and there are a lot of steps you need to take to cover every area.

3
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:23,140
This election will be an overview of what you can do to make your team and plug an accessible to people

4
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:26,290
with disabilities before we make any changes.

5
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:30,390
It's important to understand the various kinds of disabilities you may come across.

6
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:38,020
Usually they can be categorized into four different topics visual such as blindness or colorblindness,

7
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:45,610
hearing such as deafness or being hard of hearing motor such as a lack of fine motor skills or difficulty

8
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:52,390
in using a mouse or mousepad cognitive such as learning difficulties, attention deficit disorders or

9
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:53,070
dyslexia.

10
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:58,720
It's usually up to the producer of the content to determine how to tackle these situations.

11
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:04,060
However, as developers, we should also take the time to help users navigate around the site.

12
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:14,660
The topic we're discussing is what HTML5 calls Aria Aria is short for accessible, rich Internet applications.

13
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:19,730
In the resource section of this lecture, I provide a link to where you can find more information about

14
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:20,380
this topic.

15
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:25,160
As you can see, there's a lot of information here and a lot of attributes.

16
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:27,960
You can say we won't be going over all of them.

17
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:30,740
This is just a brief introduction to this topic.

18
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:32,300
So let's get started.

19
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:37,450
One of the first steps you can take is to make the elements on your page more understandable.

20
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:43,820
For example, on the sidebar, I have the search widget, if you can recall, this is formatted using

21
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:46,180
these search form template to us.

22
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:47,620
It's clear what this will do.

23
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:53,510
However, that's because we can identify the search icon inside the button and know right away what

24
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:56,960
it means for people who can't or don't understand.

25
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:01,280
We will need more information, especially people who can't see this visually.

26
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:03,830
Open the search form template.

27
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:12,670
This button is entirely made up of HTML and no text in order to provide more information about this

28
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:16,420
element, we can apply an attribute called Ariah Dash label.

29
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:21,590
The value for this attribute can be anything you want.

30
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:26,060
Usually you would provide a short and concise description about this element.

31
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:29,500
I'm going to input search just like that.

32
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:35,590
If a user is using a device such as a screenwriter, then they'll easily be able to identify what this

33
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:36,320
button does.

34
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:40,960
You can apply the Ariah Dash label attribute to any element you like.

35
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,790
There are some exceptions, though.

36
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:48,760
Image tags don't need this attribute because there's the alt attribute that already does something similar

37
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,720
to the Ariah Dash label attribute.

38
00:02:51,490 --> 00:02:52,760
Let's keep moving forward.

39
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:57,070
One of the biggest ways you can make your site navigable is by using rolls.

40
00:02:57,430 --> 00:03:00,510
Rolls are a way to categorize the sections of your site.

41
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:03,420
They're very simple and straightforward to use.

42
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:08,680
If you look at the search form template, you'll notice we have an attribute called Roll.

43
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:13,850
By adding this attribute, you can specify the type of content that's inside this element.

44
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:16,780
This is a great and simple attribute to use.

45
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:21,660
It allows for users to skip around without having to go through each individual element.

46
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:25,000
Let's play with the raw, attribute some more.

47
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:26,800
Open the header template.

48
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:32,790
I'm going to apply the role attribute to the header element.

49
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:35,000
I'm going to set this to Baner.

50
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:42,720
The banner is the value you want to set to the element that contains the logo and navigation links,

51
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:46,160
go to the page that describes Ariah in detail.

52
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:51,830
If you click no to, you'll be taken to a list of all the values that role can be set to.

53
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:56,570
There are dozens of them available will only be using the more major ones.

54
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:59,670
So we told the user where the header is.

55
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:03,870
The next region we can set is the main content side bar and footer.

56
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,300
Open the single template next.

57
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:15,110
Applying the role attribute to the div tag with the class post content, I'm going to set this to mean.

58
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:21,120
This will tell the user this is where the main content is located.

59
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:26,190
I want to highlight that you should only apply this region once as a standard.

60
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:29,580
You usually only have one region for the main content.

61
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:31,800
You don't want to confuse the user.

62
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:34,230
Be conscious of where you define this region.

63
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:35,330
All right.

64
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:39,690
Let's keep going on open the sidebar template and apply the role.

65
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:41,160
Complimentary attribute.

66
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:51,190
This will specify the sidebar region, lastly, open the footer file and apply the roll content info

67
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:52,900
attribute to the footer element.

68
00:04:55,720 --> 00:05:01,480
This is a weird name, but this is usually the name of the region for the footer, just like that,

69
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,270
we set all our regions.

70
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:07,000
There are so many more things we could do to make this thing accessible.

71
00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:08,620
But I'm going to stop right here.

72
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:15,020
If you want to test a theme for accessibility, you can simply use a tool called wave web accessibility.

73
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:16,780
I'll provide a link to this.

74
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:21,300
In the resource section of this lecture, I'm going to give some final thoughts.

75
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:25,770
I find that adding accessibility to my themes is not a high priority.

76
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:32,140
I usually tackle accessibility last and I don't build upon it unless the product I'm building has high

77
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:32,720
usage.

78
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:35,460
It really is a case by case scenario.

79
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:40,720
It's up to you in the end, if you want to make your themes and plugins accessible, it's never a bad

80
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,710
idea to do so.
