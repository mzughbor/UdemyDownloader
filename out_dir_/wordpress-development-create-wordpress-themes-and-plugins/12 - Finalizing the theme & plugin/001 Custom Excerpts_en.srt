00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:10,520
And this section will be cleaning up our theme even further.

2
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:16,640
I just want to adjust a couple of things and prepare everything for production that includes translations,

3
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,360
bundling, plug ins, et cetera.

4
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:23,420
Of course, we'll have to learn how to battle, test our theme and plug in, which is what we'll tackle

5
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:24,560
in this section as well.

6
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:25,970
Let's begin.

7
00:00:26,270 --> 00:00:30,620
If you take a look at the homepage, you'll find all the posts we've created thus far.

8
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:34,410
However, each post excerpt has these dots right after it.

9
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:36,650
Each of these are called an ellipsis.

10
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:41,490
And while they may seem great, I personally don't like them inside the functions file.

11
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:44,840
We're going to add the filter hook called excerpt more.

12
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:53,080
This hook will pass and the ellipsis for filtering, however, we want to get rid of these dots, there's

13
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:56,670
a handy utility function that WordPress provides to return nothing.

14
00:00:57,100 --> 00:01:01,660
Instead of defining our own function that will return nothing, I'm going to pass in the function.

15
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:04,569
Underscore, underscore, return, underscore, false.

16
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:14,200
This is a WordPress function that does exactly as it's named, it will return false open the WP Desh

17
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:18,060
includes function, file and search for this function.

18
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:28,920
Here is what WordPress is useful for, returning false two filters easily, if you scroll above, there

19
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:33,220
is even a function for returning true, which is also useful if you ever need it.

20
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:38,090
I encourage you to explore these functions if you ever need to use them in your own code.

21
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:41,300
Let's refresh the page and see if the dots are gone.

22
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:42,690
All right.

23
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:47,670
That's it for the excerpt in the next few lectures will continue with working on our theme.
