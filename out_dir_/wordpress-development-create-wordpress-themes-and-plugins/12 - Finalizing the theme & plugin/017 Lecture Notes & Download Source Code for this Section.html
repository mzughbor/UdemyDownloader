Thanks!</p><h4>LectureNotes</h4><p><strong>Custom Excerpts</strong></p><ul><li><p>WordPress defines a set of functions that you can use in your own themes and plugins. You can check them out in the <strong>wp-includes/functions.php</strong> file.</p></li></ul><p><strong>CustomAuthor Fields and Avatars</strong></p><ul><li><p>WordPress provides 2 sets of hooks for editing and updating the user profiles. One set is for the user to update their own profiles and another set to allow users to modify other profiles.</p></li><li><p>The URL must be a live HTTP URL for avatars. Otherwise, you will not be able to use custom avatars.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Image Cropping</strong></p><ul><li><p>An image that is soft cropped will be cropped to a specific dimension. However, if the image ratio cant be kept intact, then WordPress will try its best to crop the image to the size you specified.</p></li><li><p>An image that is hard cropped will be cropped to an exact dimension. If the ratio cant be kept intact, WordPress will cut the image so the size desired will be used.</p></li><li><p>If you decide to hard crop, then you have the ability to crop the image from certain positions like the center or top right corner.</p></li><li><p>Its important that you regenerate all the thumbnails on an existing site because not all existing images will be resized.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Main QueryHome Page Modifications</strong></p><ul><li><p>You are allowed to modify the main query using a hook. The <strong>WP_Query </strong>class has a method called <strong>set()</strong> which allows you do to this.</p></li><li><p>Keep in mind that the hook will be applied to all pages and not just the home page. Make sure to perform checks to see what page youre currently on.</p></li><li><p>The <strong>query_posts()</strong> function will also allow you to modify the main query, but its highly recommended you dont use it.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Admin Notices</strong></p><ul><li><p>Admin notices are messages that appear on the top of every page to provide more information about anything you want.</p></li><li><p>Admin notices must be managed by you. You must take care of displaying them and removing them.</p></li><li><p>You can use the <strong>notice</strong> class to make your notice fit properly on the page. There are various other classes for changing the color.</p></li><li><p>Use JavaScript to listen for click events on the exit button to help determine if the notice should be removed or not.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Debugging Hooks,Queries and Tools</strong></p><ul><li><p>There are many tools and techniques to debugging WordPress. Most of it is just preference.</p></li><li><p>WordPress still store all hooks and their functions inside the <strong>wp_filter </strong>global variable.</p></li><li><p>All queries are stored inside the <strong>wpdb-&gt;queries</strong> property. Only queries that have been executed will be stored.</p></li><li><p>The <strong>Query Monitor</strong> plugin will keep track of all queries, hooks, scripts, styles, requests and many more things for you.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Securing the wp-config File</strong></p><ul><li><p>WordPress will look for the config file inside the root installation or up one directory. Its recommended you move it up one directory on a production server for extra security.</p></li></ul><p><strong>SEO, Schema and Microdata</strong></p><ul><li><p>Microdata are attributes that you can apply to your elements to tell bots/crawlers more about the content its look at.</p></li><li><p>You are allowed to have types nested within each other. All types are children of the type <strong>Thing</strong>.</p></li><li><p>You can test your microdata using the structured data testing tool provided by Google. This tool will give you insight on what Google sees.</p></li></ul><p><strong>RTLSupport</strong></p><ul><li><p>RTL stands for right-to-left. There are languages that and read and written like this.</p></li><li><p>Its optional to add support for these languages. You only need to check if the site is set to RTL using the<strong> is_rtl() </strong>function. If it is, then youll need to use CSS to make everything appear RTL.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Accessibility</strong></p><ul><li><p>Disabilities can be put into 4 categories which are visual, hearing, motor and cognitive.</p></li><li><p>HTML5 has a feature called ARIA. Its short for <strong>accessible rich internet applications.</strong> This will help make your theme/plugin more accessible.</p></li><li><p>The <strong>aria-label</strong> attribute will help make someone with a disability understand what that element does. Some elements dont need this as they have their own attributes for this sort of thing.</p></li><li><p>The <strong>role</strong> attribute allows you to describe a section on the page such as the content or footer.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Child Themes</strong></p><ul><li><p>Child themes allow you to modify a theme without having to modify the parent theme files. Your code will be safe from being overridden as well.</p></li><li><p>To create a child theme you need to set the <strong>Template </strong>property to the parent theme folder.</p></li><li><p>Its important that you correctly load both parent and child theme CSS files.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Translations</strong></p><ul><li><p>The process for translating a plugin/theme is called internationalization. WordPress utilizes the GetText PHP extension for translation strings.</p></li><li><p>Translating WordPress can be time consuming. Its recommended you use a program like Po edit or Loco translate.</p></li><li><p>The <strong>pot </strong>file is template file translators can use as a start. The <strong>po </strong>file is the actual language file that will be compiled into <strong>mo </strong>file. The <strong>mo </strong>file is a server readable only file that contains all your translations.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Bundling Plugins with TGMPA</strong></p><ul><li><p>The TGM plugin activation class will help you with creating a UI and keeping track of what plugins the user should install.</p></li><li><p>Plugins can come from anywhere. They can be hosted from WordPress or come bundled with your theme.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Licensing and Making money with your Plugin/Theme</strong></p><ul><li><p>WordPress is licensed under GPL. This may be a problem if you want to sell your themes/plugins. This can lead to a problem called dual/split licensing.</p></li><li><p>You can sell your plugin/theme independently or you can sell on marketplaces such as CodeCanyon or ThemeForest.</p></li></ul><p><strong>ThemeStarter Alternatives</strong></p><ul><li><p>Sometimes youll want to speed up the development process of creating a theme.</p></li><li><p>The best free starter theme is underscores. It comes with a lot of templates and utility functions for getting you started.</p></li><li><p>Genesis is a premium starter template with a lot of support and big community. Canvas is another starter template provided by WooCommerece.</p></li></ul>
