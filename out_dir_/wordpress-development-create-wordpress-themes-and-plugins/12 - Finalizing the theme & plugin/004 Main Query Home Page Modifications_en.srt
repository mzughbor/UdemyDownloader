1
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:13,850
The homepage features a list of posts submitted, however, I want to expand on this, I also want to

2
00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:15,610
display recipe posts as well.

3
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:18,250
There are two solutions to accomplish this.

4
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:22,890
The first solution would be to create our own query, ignoring the main query.

5
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:25,220
However, that's a lot of work to do.

6
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:30,530
And we don't want to completely ignore the main query as other plugins may want to modify how it works.

7
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:34,370
Luckily, we can modify the main query to suit our needs.

8
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:36,920
This is the best solution and it's easy.

9
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:42,100
Inside the functions file at an action hook called pre get posts.

10
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:46,520
The function I want to call will be named Jiyu Modify home page query.

11
00:00:48,910 --> 00:00:55,810
Inside the includes folder, create a file named Home Dash Query and define the function inside this

12
00:00:55,810 --> 00:00:56,200
file.

13
00:00:56,620 --> 00:00:58,390
Lastly, include this file.

14
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:08,390
This hook will be called when the main query is created, but it will not be executed at this point

15
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,370
since it's not being executed.

16
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:13,360
We have the opportunity to modify it as we please.

17
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,700
This function will be passed in an object called Query.

18
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:22,010
Whenever we work with the WP query class, we always created a new instance.

19
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:27,080
However, at this point, we already have an instance to modify a query.

20
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:28,310
After it's created.

21
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:32,710
We have to use a method called set, but we'll get to that in just a moment.

22
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:38,000
Something that you need to keep in mind is that this hook will always give you the main query for every

23
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,980
page, not just the home page.

24
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:45,320
Since this is the case, we have to use a conditional statement to check for two things.

25
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:50,300
We have to check if this query is for the home page using the IS home method.

26
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:57,410
Then we need to use the is main query method to check if this is the main query.

27
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:07,030
If both return true, then we'll modify query, I'm now going to call the set method and set the post

28
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:11,750
tight parameter to an array that contains the name of the post types I'd like to retrieve.

29
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:15,200
I want to get the post and recipe post types.

30
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:23,990
In the resource section of this lecture, I provide a link to the WP query class again, you'll find

31
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:27,050
more information about these methods and properties that I'm using.

32
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:28,220
All right.

33
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:30,420
Now that we've modified the main query.

34
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:31,990
Let's check out the home page.

35
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:36,090
If you refresh the page, you should have both recipes and posts appearing.

36
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:37,720
That's all there is to it.

37
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:43,280
Before I am this lecture, I want to talk about a function called query posts, which you can find in

38
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,030
the resource section of this lecture.

39
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:50,720
There is a function that you can use to modify the main query, but I highly recommend you don't use

40
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:50,900
it.

41
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:57,080
If you take a look, you'll find this note from WordPress that says note this function will completely

42
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:01,340
override the main query and isn't intended for use by plugins or themes.

43
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:07,070
It's overly simplistic approach to modifying the main query can be problematic and should be avoided

44
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:08,060
wherever possible.

45
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:14,240
In most cases, there are better, more performance options for modifying the main query, such as via

46
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:17,470
the pre get posts action within WP query.

47
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:20,390
This must not be used within the WordPress loop.

48
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,120
Try your best not to use this function.

49
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:28,220
There are a lot of things in plugins out there that use this, but it's just bad practice to do so.
