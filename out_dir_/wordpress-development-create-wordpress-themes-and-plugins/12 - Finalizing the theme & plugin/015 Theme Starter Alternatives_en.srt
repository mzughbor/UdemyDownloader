00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:12,600
Developing a theme can be really fun, but as you may have saw throughout this course, I'm all about

2
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:14,160
efficiency and organization.

3
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:18,550
Creating a theme from scratch can be time consuming to speed things up.

4
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:23,280
It's not a bad idea to use a starter template that takes care of all the boring stuff and templates.

5
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:26,130
Then you can just take it from there and customize it.

6
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:33,530
Here are some suggestions I recommend the best free starter template is called Underscores Underscores.

7
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:38,610
It's developed by a bunch of fantastic developers who all agree on how theme should be developed.

8
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:43,890
The people who develop this starter theme are the same people who work on the word press corps itself.

9
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:50,040
Every single line of code in this template has a purpose and is carefully inputted for the best practices.

10
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:53,460
If you were to download this template and view some of the code.

11
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:56,220
You'll notice that they organize their code a bit differently.

12
00:00:56,970 --> 00:00:58,140
That's perfectly fine.

13
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:00,810
You can organize your code anywhere you like.

14
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:02,790
You could do it the way I taught you.

15
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:08,210
Or you could use someone else's organization system, or you can just organize it the way you like.

16
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,770
There was no right or wrong answer here.

17
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:14,280
I recommend you download this theme and play around with it a bit.

18
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:17,300
It's well documented and easy to understand.

19
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:22,800
Another solution is under strap, which is the underscore theme, but with more features.

20
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:26,040
Specifically, it has bootstrapped for included.

21
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:29,730
If you like bootstrap, then this might be something you'll want to use.

22
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:32,820
Next up is Sage by Roots.

23
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:35,790
This starter theme is for hardcore developers.

24
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:39,780
Out of all the recommendations I provide, this one is the most advanced.

25
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:46,020
It goes beyond the basic PVP includes statements and has support for bootstrap, for blade templates

26
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:46,980
and so much more.

27
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:49,950
This is something I want to go over with you in the future.

28
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:54,360
Let me know on the comments if you'd be interested in a section for this starter theme.

29
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,420
I truly believe it would be beneficial to anyone.

30
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:01,110
An alternative is called Genesis by Studio Press.

31
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:04,800
This is the most popular premium starter template available.

32
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:07,770
I hear nothing but good things about this template.

33
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:12,780
It's about sixty dollars, but it comes with so many features and it comes with functions that would

34
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:14,640
be useful to you for team development.

35
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:18,060
The support is top notch and the code is well written.

36
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:21,390
I highly recommend this if you need help with theme development.

37
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,470
Another starter template is from Wu Commerce called Storefront.

38
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:30,630
Storefront is a starter template that comes with e-commerce integration out of the box.

39
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:33,120
It provides good practices and support.

40
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:37,950
I encourage you to explore any of these themes to learn more about theme development.
