00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:12,770
A lot of languages in the world are written from left to right, English, French and German are just

2
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:16,260
some examples of languages that are read and written from left to right.

3
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:21,110
There are languages out there that read left to right or RTL like Arabic.

4
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:26,370
In these cases, having your theme support, these languages can increase your reach and sales.

5
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:31,310
Unfortunately, there is a problem, which is most of our content by default.

6
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:33,280
Is Elter meaning left to right?

7
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:40,780
Actually, developing a theme or plugin for RTL sites requires that you set up a WordPress RTL installation.

8
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:42,620
This would take too much time.

9
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:48,320
Luckily, there is a plug in that someone developed that will help us test our site with RTL content,

10
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:51,740
go to the admin dashboard and navigate to plugins.

11
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:55,250
Add new search for the plug in called RTL Testor.

12
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:56,840
Install and activate it.

13
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:10,070
This plugin will add a new menu item on a Nalpas that will let you switch from Elter to RCL, switch

14
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:11,510
your site to RTL.

15
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:13,680
You'll notice things don't really change.

16
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:18,410
That's because we need to prepare the success that will move things from right to left.

17
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:23,300
This isn't a success course, so I won't be going over how the system works.

18
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:24,680
Be aware of that.

19
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:29,440
To make a site RTL, you have to access code that makes it appear RTL.

20
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:33,110
I've already created this access files that changed things.

21
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:40,310
To load these files, we have to register and interview them, open the includes the front end queued

22
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:42,920
up file to save some time.

23
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:45,800
I'm just going to paste the register of styles functions.

24
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:54,380
All these styles will make the necessary changes required to make the site and content arty already.

25
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:57,880
However, I don't want to include these files right away.

26
00:01:58,190 --> 00:02:04,190
I want to check to see if the site is in RTR mode inside a conditional statement called The Function

27
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:05,240
is ARTlE.

28
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:14,070
If this function returns true, then that means the site is in RTL mode, if it is an RTL mode, then

29
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:17,580
I'm going to interview all the styles we just registered like so.

30
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:31,240
Now that we're loading the RCL styles, let's test it out, go ahead and refresh the page, the content

31
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:37,060
should now be reading from right to left, switch back to LTA to test if the site returns to normal.

32
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:39,970
After confirming the changes, you should be finished.

33
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:46,280
Adding RTL support is as easy as including the Cyesis files needed to make a site RTL.

34
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:50,830
You don't have to use any special functions or change the core.
