00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:09,270
Let's get started with child themes.

2
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:15,500
If you heard of child themes but don't know what or how a child theme works, then this lecture is important

3
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:15,920
for you.

4
00:00:16,309 --> 00:00:21,530
A lot of developers avoid child themes because WordPress doesn't really make it clear how to develop

5
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:22,750
or use child themes.

6
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:25,430
I don't want you to be one of those developers.

7
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:28,880
A child theme is extremely powerful and useful.

8
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:34,010
What makes it so useful is that you can modify an existing theme without having to worry about your

9
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:36,200
code becoming irrelevant or overwritten.

10
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:42,200
Back in the old days, if he wanted to modify a theme, then you'd have to directly edit the files.

11
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:48,050
Then when an update was available, you'd have to start all over again and keep track of all the edited

12
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:49,130
files and changes.

13
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:51,560
It was very annoying and time consuming.

14
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:57,680
When child themes were introduced, the whole process became so much easier because your code was never

15
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,320
overwritten and the theme was also not modified.

16
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:05,209
Now that you understand what child themes are, let's get started with creating one.

17
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:09,320
Go to WordPress dot org and go to the themes pages.

18
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:13,010
We're going to download a theme called M.H. Magazine Lite.

19
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:18,890
Then we're going to add this theme to our WordPress site by opening the themes folder and then dragging

20
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:21,950
the contents of the zip file into this folder like so.

21
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:34,260
Next, I'm going to copy this folder and I'm going to paste it in again, I'm going to reading this

22
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:38,730
folder and use the same name, except I'm going to append Dash child.

23
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:40,490
So I know that this is a child name.

24
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:45,710
WordPress doesn't require you to name a child.

25
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:52,300
Anyway, this is just how I prefer to do it and how I recommend you do it, open the child theme and

26
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:57,160
select every folder in files except the functions, style and screenshot files.

27
00:01:57,460 --> 00:01:58,630
Delete these files.

28
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:13,140
I'm now going to open my editor and look for the trial theme, open to functions, file and delete all

29
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:13,720
this code.

30
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:16,980
I'm just going to leave an open tag for later.

31
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:25,370
We're going to do the same to the style access file, except you should not delete the headers that

32
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:25,970
come with it.

33
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,250
From here, we're going to make two changes.

34
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:36,700
The first change is the name of this theme.

35
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:39,430
I'm going to add a child theme to the name.

36
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:47,450
Once again, this is not required, but it makes it easier to tell which theme is the parent theme and

37
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:48,710
which is the child theme.

38
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:52,580
Next, we have to define a new property called template.

39
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:56,770
The value of this property will be the name of the parent themes folder name.

40
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:01,280
In our case, it would be MH Dash magazine Dash Light.

41
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:05,780
This value is case sensitive.

42
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:10,020
Be sure to set this value correctly after that, you're all done.

43
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:14,030
Let's go to the WordPress dashboard and navigate to appearance.

44
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:20,540
We now have to make magazine light themes, activate the child themed version and then try visiting

45
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:21,020
your site.

46
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:32,280
We don't get any errors, not even in the console, but the site isn't displaying correctly.

47
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:33,470
Why is that?

48
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,060
Well, it's pretty simple.

49
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:40,580
WordPress is loading the style access file because that's what the parent team does.

50
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:46,620
WordPress will load the functions, file from the parent theme and load the child themes function file.

51
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:49,370
Let's take a look at the parents function file.

52
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:59,270
If you scroll down a bit, the parent theme and cusa a file with the function get stylesheet.

53
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:05,050
You are right, this function will return the URAI to the current theme style access file.

54
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:12,080
Even if we're using a child theme, this would be the child's style access file and not the parents

55
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,670
style access file.

56
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:18,540
The parent style access contains all the main styles for the theme.

57
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:23,990
The question is how do we load both the parent styles and the child styles?

58
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:27,590
There are a couple solutions here, but the developer friendly.

59
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:34,160
One is by using action hooks, let's open the child things function file and add the action hook WP

60
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,240
NQ Scripts.

61
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:42,160
I'm going to be using an anonymous function, since we won't be doing much with this child thing.

62
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:49,720
I'm going to register the parents style to get the parent style access, we first have to use a function

63
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:52,420
called get template directory, you or I.

64
00:04:57,250 --> 00:05:02,620
This function will get the director of the parent theme without the forward slash, since we're in the

65
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:03,890
parent team directory.

66
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:06,760
We can append the style X file name.

67
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:16,240
Next, I'm going to register the child theme style access file by using the function get stylesheet

68
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:21,100
uteri, which will return the URL of the current theme style access file.

69
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:31,810
Lastly, I'm going to interview both philes.

70
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:44,580
Refresh your site and you should now see that it's working properly just to make sure I'm going to open

71
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:49,980
the child's style access file and change the background color of the body to yellow.

72
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:57,050
Refresh the page.

73
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:01,590
That's absolutely hideous, but at least we know our styles are loading correctly.

74
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:07,900
If your changes aren't being loaded, you can press control five on your keyboard to force a refresh

75
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:09,730
with a clear cache for this page.

76
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,040
That's pretty much it for child themes.

77
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:14,380
From here, you can add anything you like.

78
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:22,930
If you were to create a file named for or for inside the child theme, then the child themes 404 template

79
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:25,080
will load instead of the parent themes version.

80
00:06:25,450 --> 00:06:27,340
It's that simple, actually.

81
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:30,670
Let's try that really quick in the address bar of your browser.

82
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:35,770
Type in some random characters and you'll see the parent themes for a four template being loaded.

83
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:43,810
Let's create our version by creating a forum for PHP file inside the child theme and just add the text

84
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:44,560
for all four.

85
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:52,940
Let's refresh this page and you will now see the child themed template being loaded instead of the parents

86
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:58,400
version, WordPress is smart enough to know which template to use your child themes.

87
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,220
Templates will be loaded over the parent themes templates.

88
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:04,520
You're now free to overwrite anything from the parent theme.
