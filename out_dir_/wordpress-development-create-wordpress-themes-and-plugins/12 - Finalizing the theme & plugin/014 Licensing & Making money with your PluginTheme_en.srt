1
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:09,240
We're almost finished here, folks.

2
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:12,350
The last step to any plug in our theme is distributing it.

3
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:14,840
Let's start by talking about licensing.

4
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:19,580
Admittedly, WordPress has had a controversial history with licensing.

5
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:26,420
Back in 2009, people predicted that WordPress would die due to dual licensing or split licensing.

6
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:29,710
WordPress is licensed under the license.

7
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:34,550
It basically means that the software is free to use, modify and distribute.

8
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:38,870
There is no secret encryption or files that you were not allowed to access.

9
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:40,460
It's all available to you.

10
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:44,960
This was considered great to many, but there was one important question some had.

11
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:47,240
What about commercial themes and plugins?

12
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:54,650
Well, technically, all plug ins and themes must all be distributed with the license to this concerned

13
00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:59,120
many developers because it meant that all their code would have to be made available for free.

14
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:01,600
However, this is far from the truth.

15
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:04,900
You are still allowed to sell plug ins and themes.

16
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:09,710
Your code must be available to modify, but that doesn't mean you can't sell it.

17
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:12,970
It's perfectly fine to sell your plugins and themes.

18
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:18,530
You can also create a license system that provides buyers a way to receive updates and support.

19
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:24,230
If you're providing your plug in or theme for free, then this topic shouldn't worry you so much.

20
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:29,180
You can simply go to WordPress, Digg, create an account and upload your plugin.

21
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,490
The rest is taken care of for you.

22
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:37,640
If you want to sell your plugin and or theme, then you have two main options available to you.

23
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:41,050
You can create your own site to attract buyers.

24
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:46,910
This would mean you would have to take care of everything from SEO to processing transactions and creating

25
00:01:46,910 --> 00:01:47,990
a licensing system.

26
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:52,130
A lot of developers have taken this route and are successful to this day.

27
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:58,160
For others, this can be a bit time consuming as it can take a long time and money to market your plugin.

28
00:01:58,550 --> 00:02:00,770
Luckily, there's another alternative.

29
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:04,430
There's a marketplace called Code Canyon and Forest.

30
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:08,090
Both marketplaces are owned by a company called an Votto.

31
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:13,250
Right now I'm on the for looking at the top selling WordPress themes page.

32
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:16,280
The most popular theme here is called Aveda.

33
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:22,400
This company is selling about two thousand copies a week at the price of sixty dollars through theme,

34
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,820
for they're able to generate a lot of revenue in.

35
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:31,550
Votto provides the licensing, transaction, processing and the marketing of your plugin and our theme.

36
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:37,310
There's a rating system, a forum, a lot of buyers and the tools to help sell your Coan.

37
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:39,980
All you have to do is provide the goods.

38
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:44,950
Of course there is a variable fee of around 20 percent, but it's well worth it.

39
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:50,330
I've personally sold on this platform and have made a decent amount of sales selling both themes and

40
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:50,900
plugins.

41
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:56,480
If you want to start receiving sales quickly, then I highly recommend you consider selling uncowed

42
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,100
Kanyon and Team Forest.
