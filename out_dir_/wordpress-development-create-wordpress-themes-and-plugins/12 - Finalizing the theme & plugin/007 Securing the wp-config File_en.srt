00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:13,450
I said it once and I'll say it again, the WP dash config file is one of the most important files in

2
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:14,770
your WordPress installation.

3
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,500
You should take every step to securing.

4
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:21,130
One simple step is by moving the file up one directory.

5
00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:28,280
Most production servers will store WordPress inside folders called Public Underscore HTML, w, WW,

6
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:28,990
or Web.

7
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:30,880
It varies from host to host.

8
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:35,020
By moving it up one directory, you could prevent access to it from the web.

9
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:37,260
In general, moving the file is easy.

10
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:42,670
Open your WordPress site and cut it from the directory, then move it up one folder like so.

11
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:48,280
Refresh your site and everything should work like normal.

12
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:52,260
So what's going on and how does WordPress know where to find the file?

13
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:55,410
Let's take a look at how WordPress loads the file.

14
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:57,390
Open the access file.

15
00:00:57,630 --> 00:01:00,810
This file runs before any code is executed.

16
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:06,510
This file will check to make sure the request being made isn't specific to a certain file or folder.

17
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:10,730
If it isn't, it'll pass the request onto the next page.

18
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:12,460
You file open this file.

19
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:20,520
Now this file will load the WP Dash blog dash header file that will then load the WP dash load file

20
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:25,990
the WP dash load file is the file that loads the WP dash config file.

21
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:29,850
However, it does some conditional checks before doing so.

22
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:35,070
It will first check to see if the file exists inside the root installation of WordPress.

23
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:37,650
If it does, then it'll load the file.

24
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:40,210
If it doesn't, it'll move on to the next check.

25
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:44,250
This statement will check to see if the file exists up one directory.

26
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:47,040
If it does, then it'll load the config file.

27
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:52,380
However, if it can't find the config file, it'll then boot up the setup page so that it can generate

28
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:53,280
the file for you.

29
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:59,190
By moving the config code, you make it just a little harder for hackers to do anything malicious.

30
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:03,330
Before I am this lecture, I'm going to move the config file back.

31
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:08,190
Since we're working on a local server, I'm not really concerned about where this file is placed.

32
00:02:09,169 --> 00:02:09,750
Oh.
