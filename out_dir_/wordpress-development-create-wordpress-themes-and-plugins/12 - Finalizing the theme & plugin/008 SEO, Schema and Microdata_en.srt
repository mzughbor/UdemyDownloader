1
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:13,780
ASIO is a beast of its own as a developer, you should take every step to make sure your theme is security

2
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:16,210
and is compatible with most SEO plug ins.

3
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:19,300
There are dozens of them out there throughout this course.

4
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:24,220
We've prepared the theme to be CEO already, but we can definitely take it a step further.

5
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:27,580
Right now, I'm on a site called Schema Dog.

6
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:33,430
I'll provide a link in the resource section of this lecture schema is a way to tell bots and crawlers

7
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:35,220
more about the content on your site.

8
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:41,710
Currently, if a crawler like Google's Crawler were to read through our HTML, it would have to guess

9
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:43,510
what kind of content is being read.

10
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:49,330
Google's algorithm is smart enough to be able to sort through all the HTML and make good guesses.

11
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:51,310
However, we can help.

12
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:53,710
This is where microdata comes into play.

13
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:59,290
You can add attributes to certain tags to the crawlers and bots know what they're looking at and decide

14
00:00:59,290 --> 00:01:00,790
how important the content is.

15
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:07,180
Most SEO plugins will assist you by adding some micro data for you, but there are just some sections

16
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:08,010
it can't reach.

17
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:11,020
So it's our job to cover those missing spots.

18
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,340
This site will provide you everything you need to know about microdata.

19
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:19,180
If you go to the documentation, you'll find a link for getting started.

20
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:21,880
We won't be going over every little thing.

21
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:23,820
I'll just cover the main points.

22
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:24,910
It isn't that hard.

23
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:34,530
Microdata is just a fancy word for a few set of specific HTML attributes that specify what kind of content

24
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:39,780
a bot or crawler is viewing, the first attribute you use is called the item scope.

25
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:45,300
Just by including this attribute, you're specifying that the HTML element contains information about

26
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:45,780
something.

27
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:52,050
The next property is the item type where the value of this attribute is that you are able to share more

28
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:54,210
information about this element can be found.

29
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:59,030
The Eurail must point to schema dog and to the appropriate page.

30
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:03,020
We'll talk more about these URLs and how you would go about setting them.

31
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:09,509
The last property is Item Propp, which is an attribute you set to specify how the element is related

32
00:02:09,509 --> 00:02:10,590
to the item type.

33
00:02:10,949 --> 00:02:13,860
It gives you the ability to fully describe the content.

34
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:19,670
These three attributes are the attributes you'll use the most when adding microdata to your templates.

35
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:24,660
It may seem kind of confusing at first, but you'll get the hang of it once you start adding them.

36
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:29,020
Let's start using them on the schema site.

37
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:34,510
I want you to click on the schemas link, you'll be taken to a page where you can view certain types

38
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:35,920
or view the full list.

39
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:39,000
I'm going to view the full list on this page.

40
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:44,620
You'll see the full hierarchy of types you can select when you get started with microdata.

41
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:48,490
The very first thing you want to do is think about what type you want to set.

42
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:54,580
In general, your website is a type of data that sounds weird, but just go with me on this.

43
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:58,050
If you look around, you'll find a type called Web page.

44
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,050
Click on this.

45
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,800
Here is what schema has to say about this type.

46
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:06,870
Every Web page is implicitly assumed to be declared to be of type Web page.

47
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:11,520
So the various properties about that Web page such as Breadcrumb may be used.

48
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:17,170
We recommend explicit declaration of these properties are specified, but if they are found outside

49
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:20,420
of an item scope, they will be assumed to be about the page.

50
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:25,990
We really don't have to set this type, but I believe it's a good example when it comes to getting started

51
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:26,880
with microdata.

52
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:30,250
I want you to open the header file from our theme.

53
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:38,300
Search for the opening body tag and applying the items scope attribute, this is the first step.

54
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:43,880
By applying this attribute, you're telling the crawler that this element contains information the crawler

55
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:44,780
should be aware of.

56
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:48,770
The next attribute you need to set is the item type attribute.

57
00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:52,190
The value of this attribute is the Eurail to that type.

58
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:53,870
This is an important step.

59
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:59,720
As I stated previously, it must be a Eurail to where more information can be found about that type.

60
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:07,340
The normal is the full you url http colon's schema, Doug, followed by the type.

61
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:10,940
You can also just copy and paste the URL you find here.

62
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:20,120
It's important to understand that only you, orell to the schema dog site, are allowed on, other sites

63
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,209
will just be ignored.

64
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:25,100
The bot will see this and then look at the URL for reference.

65
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:30,320
By looking at this page, it'll understand what kind of property you can set and what you can expect

66
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,850
to look for when it's scanning all the children elements.

67
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:34,260
That's the basics of it.

68
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:38,570
There is one more attribute, but I want to use that in another example.

69
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:44,030
It's perfectly fine to specify a type and no properties all expand more on this later.

70
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:45,920
But let's move on to the next example.

71
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:49,610
Open the single template and search for the author box.

72
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:57,540
This element contains information about the author, it would be ideal to apply some microdata to it,

73
00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:00,800
just like the last element we need to decide on the type.

74
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:05,400
If you look through the list, you'll eventually find an item called person.

75
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:12,450
Let's use this inside the template and the items, scope and item type attributes, copy and paste the

76
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:14,310
URL as the value for the type.

77
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:26,260
This time, I want to specify more information, if you look through this documentation, you'll find

78
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:28,480
all the properties we can set for this type.

79
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:30,340
One of these is name.

80
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:34,600
Every person has a name and are often Borke Display's the author's name.

81
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:38,860
To apply a property, you have to use the item Propp attribute.

82
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:42,970
Apply this attribute to the spane tag, which encompasses the name.

83
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:51,740
Then set its value to name, we're only going to apply this property, you're more than free to apply

84
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:52,700
more properties.

85
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:58,190
You'll also notice that we have a type on the body tag and a type for this element, which is inside

86
00:05:58,190 --> 00:05:58,950
the body tag.

87
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:00,530
This is perfectly allowed.

88
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:06,750
Types can have types inside them to reiterate what's going on when search engines scan this page.

89
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:08,780
They will eventually come upon this element.

90
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:14,810
Upon scanning it, it'll find the attribute item SCOP telling it that the developer is specifying what

91
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:16,880
kind of information is inside this element.

92
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:20,510
It will then look for a type which in this case is person.

93
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:23,480
It will then search through the properties for this type.

94
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:26,630
This is how you would go about using microdata.

95
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:33,230
So far we've used only the Web page and person types, but there are dozens of them on this page.

96
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:35,600
Some are even children of certain ones.

97
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:41,570
For example, the type thing is the parent of all these types, including Web page and person.

98
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:47,330
If we look at the Web page type, you can see we can get even more specific with the type by seeing

99
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:50,360
the page is an about page or contact page type.

100
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:52,700
The more specific you are, the better.

101
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:55,460
I'm going to give some closing thoughts.

102
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:58,720
Adding microdata is absolutely not required.

103
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,790
You'll find that a lot of sites don't use microdata.

104
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,050
It's more or less a way to help search engines better understand a page.

105
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:10,710
If you forget to add microdata to a comment or to an article, then that's fine.

106
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:15,620
Search engines will still scan the elements and try to understand the content on its own.

107
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:21,680
These attributes are just a way to help it better understand your content without having to guess if

108
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,540
you're having trouble using microdata.

109
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:29,570
I highly recommend you work with an SEO specialist and work together to maximize the CEO of your theme.

110
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:34,820
To test your snippets, you can go to the structured data testing tool from Google.

111
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:36,530
I'll provide a link to this.

112
00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:42,380
In the resource section of this lecture, you just paste in a tutorial or just paste in a small snippet

113
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:45,200
of code and Google will tell you how it reads that data.

114
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:48,440
Since we're on a local server, we really can't test it.

115
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:52,040
That basically sums up micro data and how to use them.

116
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:53,690
I highly encourage that.

117
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:57,770
You read the documentation to learn more about what you can do with Microdata.
