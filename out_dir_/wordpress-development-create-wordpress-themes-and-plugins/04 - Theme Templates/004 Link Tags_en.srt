The next set of tanks, we'll talk about our link tanks, these are tanks that return or output links

2
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:14,540
to different pages of your site.

3
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:19,090
You can use these functions to generate links to a specific post or the home page.

4
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:23,200
Here's a list of functions that take care of generating those girls.

5
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:27,450
A lot of these are pretty straightforward, so I won't be talking about most of them.

6
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:33,180
I just want to focus our attention on the get search link and the search query functions.

7
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:41,300
Right now, I'm inside my editor and I have the search template opened up, I'm going to scroll down

8
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:44,200
to the search box section and add my code here.

9
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:50,840
So one of the more interesting functions is the get search link function, as its name suggests.

10
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:53,690
This will return a zero to the search page.

11
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:55,910
I'm going to echo this function at.

12
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:03,880
This function has an optional parameter which will add a search term to the Eurail I'm going to pass

13
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:07,140
in the text hello immediately right after this.

14
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:11,530
I'm going to echo a break tag and call the function the search query.

15
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:14,570
That should do it.

16
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:20,510
Let's switch to the browser and try searching for something after a quick search, the search template

17
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:21,810
will load in our results.

18
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:26,000
Let's shift our focus to the text outputted above the search box.

19
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:27,470
Two things are output.

20
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:31,680
It first is the euro generated by the get search link function.

21
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:36,380
You'll notice that the euro generated is different than the euro up in the address bar.

22
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:39,500
There are two ways to load the search template.

23
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:47,210
You can add the first query to the URL or you can access the search page, followed by the phrase like

24
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:51,430
Here I'm going to copy this URL and paste it into the address bar.

25
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:54,280
We should see the search template load again.

26
00:01:54,680 --> 00:02:00,650
You'll also notice the value from the search query function also changes the value in the euro.

27
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:02,780
Is the value outputted from this function?

28
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:06,170
I'm going to comment out the code we added in the template.

29
00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:13,630
That's basically it when it comes to think tanks, they output you URLs and they're mostly straightforward.

30
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:19,700
I only showed the search functions because I wanted to demonstrate the various ways to access the search

31
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:20,170
template.

32
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:24,500
I also wanted you to understand why WordPress generated that URL.
