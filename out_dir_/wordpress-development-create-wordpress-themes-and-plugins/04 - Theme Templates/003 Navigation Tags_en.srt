00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:10,850
When it comes to navigation tags, there's not much to go over.

2
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:15,380
If you look at the list of functions, you'll see that there are only two functions.

3
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:19,570
We've already gone over the first function and the second one is not that important.

4
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:21,620
There is one thing I didn't mention, though.

5
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:24,680
Let's go ahead and click on the WP now.

6
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:30,410
Menu function on the sidebar, you'll find a link to the section menu item CSS classes.

7
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:36,500
Upon clicking this link, you'll be provided a list of classes that WordPress will apply to the navigation

8
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:37,340
menu generated.

9
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:41,780
If you're creating your own walker, then these classes won't be applied.

10
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:43,940
You'll have to apply them manually.

11
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:47,840
WordPress also doesn't load any styles for these classes.

12
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:50,580
It's up to you to take advantage of them in your theme.

13
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:54,590
Currently, the theme we have isn't using any of these classes.

14
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:56,030
That's perfectly fine.

15
00:00:56,270 --> 00:00:57,970
We don't need them anyway.

16
00:00:58,010 --> 00:00:59,320
That's all I wanted to show you.

17
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:01,520
Let's move on to the next set of tanks.
