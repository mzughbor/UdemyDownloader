1
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:13,010
I want to get into talking about plug ins, but before we get to that, let's go over to temple attacks

2
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:13,340
again.

3
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:17,620
In the past two sections, we've been using template tag to display content.

4
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:19,070
They're pretty straightforward.

5
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:24,410
You simply call a function and data gets out, put it, the purpose of a template tag is to make your

6
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:30,150
code cleaner rather than querying the database and processing the data you can just call a simple function.

7
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:34,340
This is ideal because it allows you to put logic into its own file.

8
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:41,060
You even have the ability to create your own template tags, just create a regular page function and

9
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:42,440
then call it in your templates.

10
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:47,480
You can use the functions file to define your custom template tags.

11
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:53,090
Since that file gets loaded before your template does, let's break down template tags even further.

12
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:57,590
In most cases, you'll find that template tags come in one of two versions.

13
00:00:57,830 --> 00:01:00,910
There's the get version and the non get version.

14
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:04,220
This doesn't apply to every tag, but it is common.

15
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:08,150
The non get version will echo out the value immediately.

16
00:01:08,690 --> 00:01:11,180
The get version will return the value.

17
00:01:11,690 --> 00:01:14,930
In the past, we've used both versions for various reasons.

18
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:20,570
Usually you want to use the non get version unless you need to process the data further.

19
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:26,290
Another thing you should be aware of is that most template tags have parameters to modify the value.

20
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:29,390
And this example I'm using the title function.

21
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:34,700
If we wanted to apply some div tag to the title, then there are two ways to go about it.

22
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:41,080
We can surround the function with the HTML or we can pass it into the function as parameters.

23
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:44,040
These two solutions will result in the same thing.

24
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:47,600
The main difference is whether you'll allow WordPress to handle it.

25
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:50,570
There is one advantage to passing in the HTML, though.

26
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:55,760
WordPress has a feature called Filter Hooks, which allow you to modify values.

27
00:01:56,120 --> 00:02:00,380
Template tags contain hooks which can then be used by developers like you and me.

28
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:05,090
By being provided the HTML, we can make changes to it if we wish.

29
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:11,510
For the most part, though, most developers tend not to pass in the parameters and hard html.

30
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:16,670
Instead, when we start working on plugins, you'll understand how you can use these parameters and

31
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:17,690
extend them on your own.

32
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:25,280
For this section, we're going to need a template that we can experiment to create a new template called

33
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,300
experimental.

34
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:34,130
You can name this whatever you want, since this will be a custom template, this template will be pretty

35
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:34,850
straightforward.

36
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,670
Open the full dash with dash page template and copy the code from that template into our new one.

37
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:45,510
We're going to be making big changes to this template.

38
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:48,710
First, we're going to remove the loop completely.

39
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:56,690
Then up in the page title, remove the subtitle and change the main title to experimental code.

40
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:04,650
Lastly, let's update the template name to experimental.

41
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:11,440
Once you've made those changes, I want you to navigate to the WordPress dashboard and create a brand

42
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,040
new page.

43
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:14,350
You can name this page, whatever you want.

44
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:15,250
It doesn't matter.

45
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:21,010
What does matter is that you select the experimental template in the dropdown and save your changes.

46
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:33,290
Now that we're finished with that, we can begin exploring template tags.
