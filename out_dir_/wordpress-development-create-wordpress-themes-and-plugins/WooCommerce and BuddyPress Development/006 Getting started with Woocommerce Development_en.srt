1
00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:13,720
Well, commerce is the best e-commerce WordPress plugin around it can be intimidating at first for developers,

2
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:16,030
but it's one of the easiest plug ins to work with.

3
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:20,200
Unlike other plugins, WordPress is well documented, encoded.

4
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:21,700
Unlike Buddy Press.

5
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:24,630
We can find a lot of the answers to our questions online.

6
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:29,700
If your theme supports commerce, then you would be adding a whole lot of value to your theme.

7
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:34,450
It's almost the standard today to support commerce and to come bundled with it.

8
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:38,020
If you're not familiar with commerce, then let's take a quick tour.

9
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:44,230
While Commerce allows you to convert your site into a store to sell physical and or digital products,

10
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:49,510
it has over twenty one million downloads and powers, over twenty eight percent of all stores.

11
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:53,430
You'll even find a list of partners and supporters of all commerce.

12
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:58,030
This is one of the reasons why commerce is well documented and supported.

13
00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:04,360
A lot of companies and individuals rely on this software to work with so many people relying on such

14
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:06,070
a software for generating revenue.

15
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:08,860
You can imagine the amount of work needed to extend it.

16
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:12,820
This course isn't about teaching you how to use new commerce.

17
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:17,800
There are a lot of courses out there that teach you that what you'll be learning here is how to use

18
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:19,570
it in theme and plug in development.

19
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:21,160
Let's get started.

20
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:27,130
The very first step is to install and activate it, go to the admin dashboard and navigate to plug ins,

21
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:29,050
add new search for the plug in.

22
00:01:29,050 --> 00:01:31,450
Will Commerce install and activate it?

23
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:45,480
This plugin is very big, so it might take some time to install it.

24
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:50,840
Currently, this plugin is on version three, which is very new and has a lot of breaking changes.

25
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:54,140
But all the code we write will be compatible with this version.

26
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:57,690
After activation, you'll be taken to a set of wizard.

27
00:01:58,010 --> 00:02:00,860
I want you to go through it with all the default settings.

28
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:06,890
I didn't really bother going through the settings as I just use the defaults.

29
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:08,090
Nothing special.

30
00:02:08,389 --> 00:02:12,270
After going through the wizard, newcomers will also generate some pages.

31
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:13,910
This is very important.

32
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:19,760
Just like Buddy Press will, commerce needs to generate some pages to display the content it generates

33
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:20,810
and manages for you.

34
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:27,510
So be sure to generate all the pages it needs or else this won't work for things like the payment gateway.

35
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,070
I'm going to use PayPal.

36
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:30,980
It doesn't really matter at this point.

37
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:34,420
You can always configure this later to your preferred payment method.

38
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:39,680
After going through the walkthrough, you can begin with preparing our theme for compatibility with

39
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:40,280
EU commerce.

40
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:45,860
You'll notice we have a couple of messages here warning us about extra steps we need to take before

41
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:47,500
we can fully use will commerce.

42
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:53,320
You may end up getting a message telling you that the current theme does not declare who commerce support.

43
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:55,810
You may even be recommending the theme.

44
00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:59,740
Since we're developing our own theme, we won't take interest in the theme.

45
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:04,060
It should be noted that most themes are compatible with commerce by default.

46
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:09,800
Keep in mind that Woog Commerce is a WordPress plugin and uses the same functions and hooks as any other

47
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:10,220
plugin.

48
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:15,590
So even if we don't make any changes to our theme, world commerce will work as usual.

49
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:20,950
If we want to override some of commerce behavior, then we'll need to declare support for it.

50
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,340
That's simple to do.

51
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:28,670
All we have to do is call the ad team support function inside the after setup theme hook.

52
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:29,960
Let's do that now.

53
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:34,640
Open the setup file and call that function right after the other support functions.

54
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:36,380
Passan Woohoo commerce.

55
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:44,900
All this does is tell you commerce, that this thing fully supports its features and design after writing

56
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:48,860
it, we can now begin with development to make things easier.

57
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:55,450
I'm going to modify the menu to include the cart checkout and shop pages that do commerce generated.

58
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:57,350
Make sure to save the menu.

59
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:07,120
The very last thing I want to do is import some dummy data.

60
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:12,900
Luckily for us, do commerce already provides us with some dummy data we can use to test our theme with

61
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:13,650
commerce.

62
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:15,540
Go to Tool's import.

63
00:04:16,110 --> 00:04:21,120
The Will Commerce plug in provides to importers one for products and one for rates.

64
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:23,790
We won't be dealing with taxes in this course.

65
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:28,920
We only need to import some products, run the new commerce product importer.

66
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:33,120
From here you can import a CSV file with your products.

67
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:37,980
You'll be asked to upload a file, go to the WEW Commerce plugin folder.

68
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:41,220
Inside you'll find a folder called Sample Data.

69
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:48,920
This will contain quite a few files, but we're only interested in the sample underscore products,

70
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:51,380
CSC file, upload this file.

71
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:55,130
After uploading it, you'll be asked to map the values.

72
00:04:55,370 --> 00:05:00,860
Mapping is the process of making sure the values inside the file are correctly inputted into the correct

73
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:01,910
database columns.

74
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:07,860
If the file that's exported uses the same version as the commerce version, the file is being imported

75
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:10,040
in, then you won't have to worry about mapping.

76
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:11,900
The value should match up fine.

77
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:17,300
This is usually for product files that were exported with earlier versions of commerce.

78
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:23,240
The mapping may not correctly match with the current database design, since we're using a sample product

79
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,510
file from commerce.

80
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:29,750
We don't have to worry about this since it's maintained by the commerce team, they'll usually make

81
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:32,320
sure the file matches the current commerce version.

82
00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:35,210
We don't just leave everything as is and continue.

83
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:36,580
This may take a while.

84
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:37,750
Just be patient.

85
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:51,580
You should see a success message and be taken to the list of products, if not, then you can click

86
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:53,740
on the products menu on the sidebar.

87
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:58,630
We now have a couple of Dommy products imported, which is nice with that finished.

88
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:00,250
Let's take a look at what we have.

89
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:03,580
Go to the front end of the site and view the shop page.

90
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:06,440
You'll see some products imported, which is what we want.

91
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:11,220
You'll notice that the page really isn't that well spaced and our footer is broken.

92
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:17,020
This is because of the success it makes the product page for width, which pushes the sidebar to the

93
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:17,410
footer.

94
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:20,980
This only happens on the shop and single product pages.

95
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:25,300
If you were to view the checkout and cart pages, you'll notice everything looks fine.

96
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:27,040
So what is going on here?

97
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:30,460
Well, let's take a look at the cart page and try editing it.

98
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:36,370
You'll notice that this is just normal page with a short code inserted that displays the cart's contents.

99
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:38,950
You can modify this page any way you like.

100
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:42,270
I'm going to make it full width and press update.

101
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:45,040
I'm going to do the same for the checkout page.

102
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:55,010
These two pages can be fully controlled like this, however, if you were to edit the shop page, you'll

103
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:57,780
notice you can't edit the page the same way as before.

104
00:06:58,010 --> 00:06:59,150
There is no shortcode.

105
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:06,830
The reason for this is because the shop page generates more dynamic content than the other pages, because

106
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:10,130
of this, it needs more flexibility than a simple shortcode.

107
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:14,560
This is why we get different markup than the other pages in the next lecture.

108
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:18,110
We'll tackle this problem and make everything fit well with our theme.

109
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:19,830
Oh.
