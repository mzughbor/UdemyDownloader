1
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:12,180
We're almost done with Buddy Press, the last thing we want to do is learn how to make some customer

2
00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:13,350
success changes.

3
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:15,220
It's simpler than you may think.

4
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:20,410
Inside the Buddy Press Default Nouveau template, you'll find a folder called CSX.

5
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:25,120
Buddy Press will look for a folder named CSX inside your theme's folder.

6
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:30,910
If it's available, then it will look for a file named Buddy Press Access and automatically load it

7
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:31,330
for you.

8
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:36,760
I'm going to copy the entire access folder and paste it into our team's folder like so.

9
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:46,580
To verify that this is working, I'm going to open the buddy press Dominique's file, I'm going to select

10
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:50,510
the Buddy Press ID and apply a random background color change.

11
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:58,270
Refresh the page after doing so, you should see the changes applied.

12
00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:04,099
This shows that Buddy Press is now loading the stylesheets from our theme rather than its default stylings.

13
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:06,910
I'm going to remove the code we just added.

14
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:11,940
Now that we verified the case file was being loaded, we can now make some changes.

15
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:15,490
You're free to modify this Cyesis file any way you like.

16
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:17,060
It is as simple as that.

17
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:22,450
The only unfortunate part is that you need to name these files a certain way and they must be placed

18
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:24,450
inside a folder called success.

19
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:27,370
Other than that, everything else is customizable.

20
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:30,580
So that does it for the buddy press development.

21
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:33,430
Part of this course, there isn't much to it, honestly.

22
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:39,040
You'll end up doing one of three things you may want to modify the templates html.

23
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:40,870
You now know how to do that.

24
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:47,140
You just study the HTML or read the template hierarchy and add that file to your theme and their respective

25
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:47,740
directory.

26
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:50,880
Afterwards, you can make the changes you'd like to see.

27
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:54,310
You may want to hook into certain parts of Buddy Press.

28
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:59,980
It's as simple as looking for the do action function inside the templates and using that hook to output

29
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:00,970
some HTML.

30
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:06,490
In case you don't want to modify the template directly, the last thing you may want to do is make some

31
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:07,630
Cyesis changes.

32
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:11,500
And that's as simple as creating the Buddy Press Access file.

33
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:17,710
Before I wrap up this lecture and move on to the next thing you may be concerned about drastic changes

34
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:18,580
to Buddy Press.

35
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:22,720
Luckily, Buddy Press will always inform you about template changes.

36
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:27,970
If your theme supports Buddy Press, it's always best to keep up with the latest updates and to read

37
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:29,800
about them when they do release notes.

38
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:36,430
However, if for some reason you miss an email, you can always go to the Buddy Press theme development

39
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:37,720
documentation page.

40
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:42,970
On the sidebar, you'll find a list called Template Updates, followed by the version No.

41
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:45,280
I'm going to click on two point seven.

42
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:51,010
You'll be shown a list of changes made to their templates if you made a change to any of these templates,

43
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:54,550
then you just have to read through this and apply the changes manually.

44
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:59,260
This is the benefit of only copying the templates you use into your theme.

45
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:05,050
If you were to copy the entire directory into your theme, then you would end up having to apply every

46
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:06,850
single change documented here.

47
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:12,280
This is why I highly recommend you only override the templates you actually want to make changes.

48
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:17,950
You also, as you can see here, there is a lot of code and changes you'd have to make.

49
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:20,680
It's almost an entire night's worth of code here.

50
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:21,580
All right.

51
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,200
That does it for Buddy Press.

52
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:27,910
In the next couple of lectures, we're going to begin working on new commerce development.
