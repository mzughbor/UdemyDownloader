1
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:10,620
Our theme and plug in have come a long way since we first started.

2
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:15,110
It's now time to take it to the next level by working on some advanced concepts.

3
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:20,420
If you plan on selling your theme, then it would be wise to show support for some of the most popular

4
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:22,860
plugins available in this section.

5
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:26,300
We will work on adding support for Buddy Press and Will Commerce.

6
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:27,980
I want to make something clear.

7
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:31,730
By default, these plug ins are already compatible with our theme.

8
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:35,840
Most plug ins that are released to the public are compatible with WordPress.

9
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:40,970
As long as that theme and plug in are adhering to the WordPress coding standards, then they should

10
00:00:40,970 --> 00:00:42,280
be compatible with each other.

11
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:48,650
What we'll be doing is furthering the compatibility by customizing the look and feel to match our theme.

12
00:00:49,130 --> 00:00:54,410
This step is completely optional, but by doing this, you open yourself up to gaining more customers

13
00:00:54,410 --> 00:00:56,080
and learning more about WordPress.

14
00:00:56,870 --> 00:01:00,350
If you're not familiar with these plug ins, then let's take a mini tour.

15
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:04,879
In the resource section of this lecture, I provide links to both plugins.

16
00:01:05,209 --> 00:01:08,030
The first plugin will be working with is Buddy Press.

17
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:12,860
Buddy Press is a plugin that will convert your site into a social media site.

18
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:18,830
It adds features such as profiles, groups, activity streams, notifications and much more.

19
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:24,050
It's very easy to use and even comes with some default styles if your theme doesn't have any.

20
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:25,070
Woohoo!

21
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:28,990
Commerce is a plug in that will transform a WordPress site into a store.

22
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:31,790
This is one of the most popular plugins around.

23
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:36,020
It helps process payments, keep track of inventory and so much more.

24
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:42,170
On top of that, there are a lot of plugins that extend to commerce and and a plethora of features.

25
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:47,540
Adding support for this plug in is truly beneficial at this point of the course.

26
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:51,350
Things are about to get mixed up between both plug in and team development.

27
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:56,720
What I mean by this is that sometimes we'll be working in the theme and other times we'll be working

28
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:57,350
in the plug in.

29
00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:00,200
We'll be switching often, so be prepared for that.

30
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:02,960
What you're experiencing is my workflow.

31
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:04,820
This is how I prefer to work.

32
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:08,210
Actually, this whole chorus has been showing my workflow.

33
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:14,240
Whenever I start working on a custom theme, I start with breaking down my HTML template into template

34
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:17,360
parts for WordPress, just like we did in the first section.

35
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:23,540
Once I have most of the foundation set, I start working on a custom plugin for the theme to add any

36
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:24,680
features I might like.

37
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:30,890
Eventually I'll start adding in the more advanced features and integrations like Buddy Press and Commerce.

38
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:36,650
Once it gets to that point, I find myself working in both the theme and plug in at the same time.

39
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:38,450
That's perfectly normal.

40
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:39,590
And WordPress development.

41
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:43,280
Hopefully you will find that workflow optimal for you too.

42
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:45,470
If you feel otherwise, let me know.

43
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:47,420
All right, let's get to work.

44
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:49,310
Oh.
