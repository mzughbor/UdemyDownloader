1
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:12,760
Before we begin coating anything, it's important to understand the various resources made available

2
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:18,790
to us by WordPress and this lecture, I'm going to break down each resource provided by WordPress.

3
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:23,510
You can follow along with me by checking out the links in the resource section on this lecture.

4
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:30,580
If we were to search for WordPress, you'll come across two sites which are WordPress, Dotcom and WordPress,

5
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:36,190
Digg, even though they have similar domain names, you should be aware that there is a huge difference

6
00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:36,880
between the two.

7
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:42,580
The dot com domain is a hosting platform for WordPress that is supported by a private company.

8
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,510
I'll talk more about that company in just a moment.

9
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:51,280
Right off the bat, I want you to know something very important about WordPress hosting platforms.

10
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:57,510
There are a lot of them out there, but I do not recommend using these kinds of hosts as a developer,

11
00:00:57,610 --> 00:01:00,910
you'll want to have full control over your WordPress sites.

12
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:05,530
A lot of WordPress hosting platforms really limit what you can install and use.

13
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:09,130
While they're user friendly, they're not developer friendly.

14
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:15,130
Sometimes you'll have a client asking what how do you recommend for their site in these instances?

15
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:21,160
Try to recommend something which gives you the developer more flexibility as this course progresses.

16
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,870
I'll definitely talk more about hosting options and what you should be looking for in a host.

17
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:28,510
All right, let's keep moving forward.

18
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:34,590
The dot org domain is for anyone who wants to download the source code of WordPress and host it themselves.

19
00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:39,190
This is where will be spending ninety nine percent of our time throughout this course.

20
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,590
Right away you'll find a button to download.

21
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:46,450
WordPress, as of this course, will be working with version five of WordPress.

22
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:51,070
Download WordPress now as will be installing it on our machines in a future election.

23
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:57,280
Don't worry, if you see a higher version of WordPress, all code we write will be compatible with future

24
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,140
and past versions of WordPress.

25
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:04,720
Throughout this course, you'll find that features from versions as old as one point five are still

26
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:05,830
supported and used.

27
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:09,910
Let's explore this site a little more under its support.

28
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:11,200
Click documentation.

29
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,770
Here, you'll find information about WordPress and its features.

30
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:18,130
You'll notice that we're in something called the Codex.

31
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:22,780
That's just a fancy word WordPress uses to call its own documentation.

32
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:30,280
Back in the early days, WordPress used the codex for everything from code examples to simple explanations

33
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,330
about the user system.

34
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:37,540
However, as WordPress grew, the development team realized that mixing this information was not a good

35
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:37,960
idea.

36
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:44,950
So they took all the resources related to coding things and plug ins into its own site in the euro bar

37
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:47,440
changed the word codex to developer.

38
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:50,290
Remove anything after the domain extension.

39
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:56,800
Here, you'll find resources strictly related to developers throughout this course will be switching

40
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,710
between the Codex and developer resources.

41
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:04,200
From time to time, you'll find that the Codex resource contains code.

42
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:10,330
This is because the WordPress team hasn't fully transitioned all the code examples from the Codex to

43
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:11,230
the developer site.

44
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:13,720
It's currently a work in progress.

45
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:17,320
One of the great things about the site is that it is dynamically generated.

46
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:22,900
The WordPress team has made it so that this site will scan all the code and WordPress to help generate

47
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:23,820
the documentation.

48
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26,920
This way, the site is always kept up to date.

49
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:30,460
Let's explore how to use this site very quickly.

50
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:36,130
Right off the bat, you'll be provided with links to four different sections, a section for developing

51
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:38,140
themes, plug ins and applications.

52
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:43,840
This last section is actually new, which provides information on how to use the WordPress SEELIE.

53
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:47,530
We'll be exploring all of these as the course progresses.

54
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:50,320
All these sections are only guides.

55
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:56,680
If you want to look up a function or class, then you need to scroll down and click the code reference

56
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:56,980
link.

57
00:03:57,670 --> 00:04:03,040
You'll be taken to a search page where you can look up functions, hooks, classes and methods.

58
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:07,360
We haven't gone over hooks, so I don't expect you to know what that is.

59
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:08,950
Let's ignore that for now.

60
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:15,310
Right below this, you'll find that WordPress documents all the latest code added to the word press

61
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:15,640
corps.

62
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:20,320
This is a really great way to check out what functions are added on the right.

63
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:25,570
You'll find all the APIs available will be exploring most of these throughout the course.

64
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,880
Let's take a look at how to search for code.

65
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,340
I don't expect you to follow along.

66
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:35,830
You just need to understand that all this does is help you find more information about functions and

67
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:36,940
other WordPress code.

68
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:41,080
By the end of this course, you'll be more than comfortable using this tool.

69
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:47,830
All right, I'm going to search for something called the underscore content after submitting the search.

70
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:49,530
We should get about 10 results back.

71
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:51,690
I'm going to click on the first result.

72
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:57,720
WordPress will load this page that provides a lot of information on how you would go about using this

73
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,110
function.

74
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,690
There are a couple of things I want to highlight.

75
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:05,240
The first is that you'll always be provided with the original source code.

76
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:08,370
Here you'll find where WordPress defines this function.

77
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:12,600
This is a really great way to understand how WordPress functions internally.

78
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:18,330
A lot of this code may not make sense, but I assure you that you'll be able to read code like this

79
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:21,130
and understand what it means by the end of this course.

80
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,310
Next is the changelog section.

81
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:29,580
This will document when the function was first introduced and if there were ever any changes.

82
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:34,050
As you can see, this function has been around since version O, point seven one.

83
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:40,080
As I stated previously, WordPress is a popular choice because most code you write will be compatible

84
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:45,840
with earlier versions, not as early as this, but you shouldn't have any problems with a few versions

85
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,620
back down further.

86
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:50,750
You'll find a related uses section here.

87
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:53,950
You'll find where a function is used within WordPress itself.

88
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:58,060
This is a really great way to see how WordPress itself uses its own code.

89
00:05:58,470 --> 00:06:02,300
You'll find some really great examples by reading through the WordPress code itself.

90
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:06,550
The last section is the user contributed note section.

91
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:12,540
This section is available for anyone and everyone to submit some tips and tricks on how you would go

92
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:13,680
about using this function.

93
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:18,150
Something important I should highlight is that not all pages are like this.

94
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:22,800
Some pages will provide even more information and others will provide very little.

95
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:28,450
For the most part, though, functions that are commonly used tend to be documented quite well.

96
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:34,980
I know this is a lot of resources to take in, but I promise you we will definitely be going over how

97
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:37,590
to use both of these resources to your advantage.

98
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:43,320
To reiterate, the codex is where you'll find information on WordPress and all its features.

99
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:46,110
The information presented here is user friendly.

100
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:51,240
The developer site provides information related to the code of WordPress.

101
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:55,040
A lot of this information is technical and aimed at developers.

102
00:06:55,650 --> 00:06:58,650
Before I finish things off, let's explore the site.

103
00:06:58,650 --> 00:07:04,770
Automatic Dotcom Automatic is a company that makes huge contributions to the WordPress software.

104
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:08,400
They own plugins such as jetpack and newcomer's.

105
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:14,070
Even though they don't own WordPress, they do have a big influence over the open source software.

106
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:20,370
Automatic owns the dotcom domain of WordPress, but they do not own WordPress itself.

107
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:24,030
It's very important to make that distinction anyway.

108
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:24,800
That's about it.

109
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:28,560
We're almost ready to begin writing some code in the next lecture.

110
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:31,770
We're going to start setting up our system for WordPress development.
