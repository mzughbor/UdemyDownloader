1
00:00:00,890 --> 00:00:06,380
Hello and welcome to the WordPress development course, this is one of the most comprehensive courses

2
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:08,000
on WordPress development around.

3
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:13,490
By the end of this course you'll have a solid understanding of the word press corps and its APIs.

4
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:20,200
WordPress is a very powerful CMS and currently powers over 60 million websites from around the world.

5
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:22,790
That number continues to rise every day.

6
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:29,480
The average WordPress and developer makes anywhere between fifty five to eighty five thousand dollars

7
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:29,790
a year.

8
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:35,540
There are currently about two hundred and fifty thousand jobs related to WordPress posted on various

9
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:36,170
job sites.

10
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:38,920
Right now, dozens are being added every day.

11
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:43,900
Currently, WordPress has about sixty five percent of the market share.

12
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:49,250
If you look at other platforms from Drupal to Squarespace, you'll find that the user base for each

13
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:51,380
platform is small compared to WordPress.

14
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:56,200
Squarespace, for example, only takes up about five percent of the market.

15
00:00:56,660 --> 00:01:02,570
You can expect a more competitive and smaller job market since Squarespace is user base is small compared

16
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:03,260
to WordPress.

17
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:08,420
WordPress, on the other hand, it's very in demand and provides a lot of benefits.

18
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:14,300
Not only is it in demand, you'll find that the hours are flexible and you can work from anywhere in

19
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:14,750
the world.

20
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:20,240
Its popularity is due to the fact that you can create any kind of website you'd like.

21
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:26,180
You can create a simple blog out of the box, or you can create a full blown social network.

22
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:32,570
WordPress can be used to create ecommerce sites where you can sell both physical and digital products.

23
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:34,460
You could even sell services.

24
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:39,770
You can also create directories where users can find information about any subject.

25
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:42,620
You don't have to use it for big projects either.

26
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:48,740
Out of the box, you can use WordPress for smaller sites like your own personal portfolio or small business.

27
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:54,890
One of the greatest perks of developing for WordPress is that it is mostly front end agnostic.

28
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:59,990
What I mean by this is you can use any access or JavaScript framework you want.

29
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:06,350
WordPress gives you complete freedom as a result, creating responsive sites is pretty easy to pull

30
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:06,680
off.

31
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:12,830
By taking this course, you'll learn how to customize your WordPress site by creating custom plug ins

32
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:13,400
and themes.

33
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:16,850
Here's an overview of what you'll learn throughout this course.

34
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:19,130
Currently you're in Section one.

35
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:25,010
In Section one, we'll go over what WordPress is and what you need to know about the various resources

36
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:28,490
available to you will then start setting up an environment.

37
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:33,590
The Stack and WordPress itself will also dive into alternative options.

38
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:39,680
Besides, the one I go over, this section will be brief and the shortest section out of them all in

39
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:45,860
Section two will take a standard HTML template that I provide and take the first few steps to convert

40
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:48,020
it into a basic functioning WordPress theme.

41
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:53,300
The template I provide has no specific preparations made for WordPress.

42
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:57,620
This allows you to learn every step you need to take to make a template.

43
00:02:57,620 --> 00:02:58,520
WordPress ready.

44
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:02,480
As you will see, WordPress will work with any template you provide.

45
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:07,370
You'll have full control over your success and HTML structure choices.

46
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:14,540
This section is broken down to be easy to understand and simple in Section three will then continue

47
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:16,970
developing the theme by creating templates.

48
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:21,710
The template system WordPress provides out of the box is simple but very flexible.

49
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:27,230
By the end of it, you'll understand how the WordPress template system works, along with getting to

50
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:33,950
know the customizer for adding custom theme options in Section four, we'll go over any templates I

51
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:36,290
may have skipped over in the previous sections.

52
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:42,230
The templates presented in this section aren't as popular as the other templates, but you may need

53
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:44,060
to know about them randomly in the future.

54
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:48,290
In Section five, we'll start talking about plugin development.

55
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:52,490
This is where we will really get the opportunity to extend the word press corps.

56
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:56,630
We'll discuss the various APIs you can use in a practical way.

57
00:03:57,020 --> 00:04:02,330
Some of the topics we'll get into will be creating custom post types, authentication hooks.

58
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:05,990
Ajax requests security and work with the database.

59
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:11,720
By the end of the section, you'll have a better understanding of how WordPress works in Section six.

60
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:14,510
We're going to step away from WordPress for a moment.

61
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:18,770
As of WordPress five, Gutenberg was integrated into the core.

62
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:24,560
There are a lot of things you can do with Gutenberg, but in order to extend it, you need to know some

63
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:30,980
JavaScript concepts for those who aren't comfortable with things like the command line, know James

64
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:32,870
Webb, PIAC, react, etc..

65
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:34,460
Then this section is for you.

66
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:39,320
I talk about these things and give you a solid foundation to help you get started.

67
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:45,950
Once we've talked about those things, then in Section seven, our Introduce Gutenberg development,

68
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:51,080
I'll talk about how to set up your project and building a custom block from scratch.

69
00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:58,610
We'll also talk about how to use the toolbar and how to use components provided by WordPress afterwards

70
00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:00,260
in Section eight Wilkening.

71
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:06,090
Can you with Gutenberg development by talking about the other components provided by Gutenberg, things

72
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:12,420
like Rich text, the media, uploader, form comptrollers, etc., we'll cover anything that may have

73
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:19,080
been missed related to Gutenberg in Section nine, we'll explore various APIs to create things like

74
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:24,390
widgets and sugarcoats will even talk about how to authenticate and register users.

75
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:28,230
This will get us into topics such as security and nonces.

76
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:35,790
In Section 10, we'll talk about creating admin interfaces and setting up forms will manually process

77
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:37,680
those forms with various APIs.

78
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:43,710
After that, I'll show you some alternative and faster methods for performing those tasks to make you

79
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:44,790
an efficient developer.

80
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:50,640
And Section Eleven will start talking about Buddy Press and Will Commerce theme development.

81
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:54,810
I'm going to demystify some of the concepts behind these two plugins.

82
00:05:55,230 --> 00:06:00,900
By the end, you'll have a better understanding on how these two plugins work and even understand how

83
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:02,250
the word press corps works.

84
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:08,910
You'll find yourself being comfortable navigating the files and extending anything you want in Section

85
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:15,240
12 will wrap things up by adding a few more features to the plugin and theme we developed will finalize

86
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:21,990
things by learning about debugging, unit testing, translations, child themes, RTL support and so

87
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:22,530
much more.

88
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:28,350
Everything you need to do before releasing your work to the public will even talk a little about licensing

89
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,300
in Section 13.

90
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:33,000
We'll talk about some advanced WordPress concepts.

91
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:37,260
It's a very experimental section and not really required to watch.

92
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:43,760
However, you can learn a thing or two to help with more larger projects for the first twelve sections.

93
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:47,310
This course focuses on developing one plugin and one thing.

94
00:06:47,730 --> 00:06:53,130
A lot of courses out there will teach you how to build various projects so you can get practice applying

95
00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:53,790
the same thing.

96
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:58,800
However, the problem with this is that a lot of the examples aren't practical.

97
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:01,140
I like to approach things differently.

98
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:07,590
Rather than give you ten different projects that have no real world usage, we build a more realistic

99
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:08,580
theme and plug it.

100
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:12,060
By doing this, the size will get pretty big.

101
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:15,810
This forces you to learn about organization and efficiency.

102
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:19,980
You'll experience my workflow and how I would tackle big projects.

103
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,390
Don't be afraid, though.

104
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:26,610
By the end of this course you'll have the confidence to navigate your way around the project we built.

105
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:31,350
This approach allows you to learn what you need to know as problems arise.

106
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:37,290
By taking this route, you'll learn how to apply certain concepts in a more practical situation.

107
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:41,400
You'll also develop a good workflow as you continue with this course.

108
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:47,190
WordPress comes with over ten different APIs and you'll learn how to use most of them by the end of

109
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:47,820
this course.

110
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:53,370
The great thing about WordPress is that all APIs are available to you, whether you're working on themes

111
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:54,060
or plugins.

112
00:07:54,390 --> 00:08:00,630
So the things you learn while creating themes can also be applied to plugins and vice versa will take

113
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:02,970
a deeper look at this as the course progresses.

114
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:08,490
Before you even begin this course, there are a couple of requirements you need to know or have.

115
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:14,400
You will need a good understanding of HTML, VSS and JavaScript.

116
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:16,620
You'll also need to know some query.

117
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:19,650
You'll also need a local server to work on.

118
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:21,300
This can be your computer.

119
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:25,740
If you don't have one, then you'll learn how to set one up in the next couple of lectures.

120
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:30,360
You'll also need a text editor and he will do for this course.

121
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,520
I'll be using Visual Studio Code.

122
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:36,150
Lastly, you'll need a healthy thirst for learning.

123
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:40,620
There is a lot of content to digest, so you'll definitely be kept busy.

124
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:47,520
We will mainly focus on working with WordPress is inbuilt APIs, so we will not be covering most of

125
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,980
the HTML, S.O.S and JavaScript.

126
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:55,950
WordPress doesn't require you to learn any special HTML, S.O.S or JavaScript code.

127
00:08:56,370 --> 00:09:00,090
As you'll learn, WordPress is extremely flexible on the front end.

128
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:05,360
I will provide you with a static HTML design that will convert into a WordPress.

129
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:10,320
If you wish, you can use your own thing, but I highly advise against it.

130
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:15,840
While you're learning, your code should be similar to mine before you decide to freestyle anything.
