1
00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:13,220
Let's prepare our machines for WordPress development, if you already have things set up and prefer

2
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:16,390
your own kind of environment, then you're free to skip this lecture.

3
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,380
If not, then just follow along.

4
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:20,770
I'll try my best to explain everything.

5
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:24,380
The very first thing we need is a development environment.

6
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:28,520
There are various environments out there, but the one I recommend is Zamp.

7
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:34,760
It's free and constantly updated with the latest versions of software for web development to download

8
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:38,200
Zamp, you'll need to visit the site Apache Friends Dog.

9
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:42,640
I'll provide a link to this site in the resource section of this lecture.

10
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:44,010
Just a side note.

11
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:49,790
Most sites I talk about will be provided in the resource section of each lecture, so just be aware

12
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:50,090
of that.

13
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:52,970
You should see something similar to what I see.

14
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:56,630
Zamp is a program that bundles various programs together.

15
00:00:56,990 --> 00:00:59,440
Let's take a deeper look at these programs.

16
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:02,270
The very first program is Apache.

17
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:05,270
The official Apache site is Apache Dog.

18
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:11,230
Apache is actually an open source software foundation that provides free programs for everyone.

19
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:15,760
One of their most popular programs is the HTTP server program.

20
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:18,500
We can find this program under projects.

21
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:21,690
You'll find a link to the server project.

22
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:27,670
This program allows you to turn your computer into a server that accepts and sends requests.

23
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:29,960
It's very lightweight and easy to use.

24
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:32,860
The next piece of software is Maria DB.

25
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:37,640
You can find more information about the software at Maria Dbag.

26
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:42,340
Maria DB is a database that allows you to store data about anything you want.

27
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:49,130
There are all kinds of databases out there, but the most popular choices are either Oracle or My School.

28
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:55,370
My school and Maria DB are the two databases WordPress is one hundred percent compatible with.

29
00:01:55,700 --> 00:02:00,660
So you may be wondering why are we installing Maria DB instead of my school?

30
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:06,140
Well, there's a lot of business politics that I won't dive too much into because it's really boring.

31
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:07,960
But here's the overall gist of it.

32
00:02:08,510 --> 00:02:11,960
My school has seen very little development in recent years.

33
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:18,050
A lot of developers have decided to fork my school and continue developing and under a new name, which

34
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:24,830
is Maria de Borking, is just a fancy term for downloading open source code and then adding on to it.

35
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:31,430
Essentially, Maria De is my school, but with more features and is constantly updated.

36
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:37,280
So most code that you write for my school will also be compatible with Maria DB and vice versa.

37
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:42,890
I promise that all code we write will be compatible with both Maria DB and my school.

38
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:51,800
The last piece of software is that you can find the official Web site at p dot net p p is the programming

39
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,420
language WordPress is built with.

40
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:57,470
I assume you already know about p p, so I won't be talking about it.

41
00:02:58,070 --> 00:03:03,530
You'll notice that Perl is also bundled, but we won't be using Perl at all, so you don't have to worry

42
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:04,070
about that.

43
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:11,450
The X and Zamp stands for operating system, implying that Zamp is cross compatible with all operating

44
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:12,020
systems.

45
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:17,060
All these programs combined together will create an environment you can run on your computer.

46
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:21,440
This environment will allow you to install and work with WordPress locally.

47
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:26,000
There are other environments out there, but I highly recommend you use Zamp.

48
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:30,350
I find Zamp the easiest to work with out of all the environments available.

49
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:34,130
There are better options out there, but those tend to be overkill.

50
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:39,950
In the next lecture, I'll talk about other options and why we won't be using them for now.

51
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,750
Just keep following along with me.

52
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,120
Let's download and install Zamp.

53
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:49,700
There are various versions of Zamp, but I prefer the one that comes bundled with p p seven point two.

54
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:56,180
People ask me all the time what version of p p they should be using and I always recommend BB seven

55
00:03:56,180 --> 00:04:02,720
or higher p p seven is fast and allows for faster processing times, which is great for development.

56
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:05,030
Let me show you something really quick.

57
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:09,560
Go to the WordPress Dawg site and I want you to click the about link.

58
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:13,010
On the side you'll find a page called Requirements.

59
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:16,100
WordPress will recommend you work with B seven.

60
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:21,890
If you read a little further, then you'll find that the absolute minimum version you need to run WordPress

61
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:29,870
is five point two point for a lot of hosts will still use five point two or five point three.

62
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:34,180
But I'm going to recommend that you don't develop for these versions of P.

63
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:40,280
It may seem like you're limiting the amount of clients you'll work with, but you save yourself a huge

64
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,010
headache by avoiding these versions.

65
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:46,670
The reason being is that these versions are no longer supported by P.

66
00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:51,010
These versions have security vulnerabilities and exploitations.

67
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:57,170
Personally, I only developed plug ins and things that are compatible with P p seven Nannup.

68
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:03,170
A lot of developers such as Muffin Group and Theme Fusion don't even support these lower versions and

69
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:05,210
yet they still receive a lot of clients.

70
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:06,500
In the end.

71
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:06,830
It's a.

72
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:13,740
You all code we write will be compatible with IP Version seven and up, in case you were curious, you

73
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:17,090
can also check out this interesting link called Statistics.

74
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:23,190
This page shows information about the setup most hosts use and what versions of each software they're

75
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:23,580
using.

76
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:27,120
This should give you a good idea about what the market is like.

77
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:31,110
All right, let's move on, download and install Zamp.

78
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:35,560
Just go through the default settings as they usually will suit you best.

79
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:41,310
I won't be going through the installation as I've already installed one installed.

80
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:45,920
You can open up the control panel by searching for something called Zamp Control Panel.

81
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:51,930
The great thing about using Zamp is that it automatically bundles and configures most of the software

82
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:54,140
you need to run a local development environment.

83
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:55,770
It's fast and easy.

84
00:05:56,430 --> 00:06:02,070
You'll notice that Zamp installs other programs such as File, Zillah, Mercury and Tomcat.

85
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:07,620
We won't be using this software, so you don't need to worry about what these do and what they're for.

86
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:11,760
To boot the server, you need to turn on Apache and MySQL.

87
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:18,150
You should see the modules highlighted in green indicating that these modules have successfully been

88
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:20,070
turned on and are currently running.

89
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:26,070
If you don't, then be sure to read the log below and ask for support at the Apache Friends site.

90
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:29,160
We can test to see if everything is working.

91
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:34,230
By clicking the admin button inside the Apache row, you'll be taken to localhost.

92
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:35,910
You may see a welcome message.

93
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:38,430
I don't because I deleted those files.

94
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:41,810
I'll show you where to delete those files in just a moment.

95
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:48,480
Let's set up the database first, open the control panel once again and click the admin button in the

96
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,500
MySQL wrote.

97
00:06:49,890 --> 00:06:53,070
You'll be taken to a page called My Admin.

98
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:58,980
Personally, I don't like my admin because it is a web script almost like WordPress.

99
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:05,970
My admin is a way to manage and view your database inside your browser, just like any other script.

100
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:11,400
This script will load JavaScript Cyesis and handle all requests with me.

101
00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:17,130
It works, but it tends to be very slow at times because you have to wait for the page to load to know

102
00:07:17,130 --> 00:07:19,200
whether or not your request was successful.

103
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:25,500
I prefer to use something called Heidi Skill, which can be found at high school dotcom.

104
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:31,350
You can go to the download section and just download the appropriate download for your operating system.

105
00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:34,230
Heidi doesn't work well for Mac Systems.

106
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:36,180
So here's an alternative solution.

107
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:40,710
If you're on a Mac OS system, then you should check out Sequel Pro.

108
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:42,270
It's fast and free.

109
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:47,790
You should be able to connect to any MySQL and Maria DB databases without any problem.

110
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:51,420
Once you have those installed, open it up like so.

111
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:58,650
Heidi Eskil is similar to my admin, except it is written in a language called Object Pascal, which

112
00:07:58,650 --> 00:08:03,840
is a bit faster than a B and can execute MySQL queries so much faster.

113
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:08,700
This program also comes with more features which will be useful in later lectures.

114
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:12,900
It'll take some time to get used to this, but I promise it'll be worth it.

115
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,780
Using Heidi Eskil is pretty simple.

116
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:18,470
First, you need to create a new session.

117
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:20,250
Name it whatever you want.

118
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:22,290
I'll be naming mine localhost.

119
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:24,660
A lot of the default settings are pretty good.

120
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:30,570
The host should be one two seven zero zero one, which is the IP of localhost.

121
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:34,260
The username is root and the password will be left empty.

122
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:37,260
This user is automatically created for you.

123
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:40,290
When you install Zamp, everything else is fine.

124
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:42,420
Make sure to save and then click open.

125
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:45,870
You'll notice that I already have a few databases set up.

126
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,970
Let's create a new database.

127
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:55,140
You simply right click in the left column and under Create Click database you'll be presented with two

128
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:55,650
options.

129
00:08:55,800 --> 00:09:01,500
The name of the database and the colation the name will be using is You To Me and the Colation will

130
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,490
be UTSA.

131
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:08,220
And before General SII, the colation determines how characters are sorted and compare.

132
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:14,880
For example, you can have the letter A as upper case or lower case which gets displayed first.

133
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:18,720
What about characters where there's an accent above the letter A?

134
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:25,140
As you can see, there are dozens of correlations with their own set of rules on how to compare characters.

135
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:31,680
For this course we'll be using UTF eight and before General SII because it's been tested to be highly

136
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:32,940
performance and accurate.

137
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:37,770
It works with all characters, including Chinese, Japanese and so much more.

138
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,630
Click OK, and that's it.

139
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:44,100
You can click on your database in the left hand column and you'll notice that it's empty.

140
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:48,120
We can now install WordPress in the previous lecture.

141
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:49,950
You should have downloaded WordPress.

142
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:51,840
If you haven't, then do so now.

143
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:55,290
The file you downloaded should be in the form of a zip file.

144
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:57,120
Have not file in hand.

145
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,440
Next, open the Zamp control panel from the control panel.

146
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,270
Click on the Explorer button.

147
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,600
This is where Zamp is installed all files.

148
00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:12,710
That are served from the server to your browser is located in the Docs folder, he docks, stands for

149
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:19,220
hypertext documents, this folder is very important as we will be working inside it throughout most

150
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:19,970
of this course.

151
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:23,830
Feel free to delete any default files inside this folder.

152
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:25,000
You don't need them.

153
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:29,900
I already have some files here as I use them daily for web development.

154
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:35,420
Open your zip file and drag and drop the files from the zip file into this folder.

155
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:45,320
I'm going to rename this from WordPress to you to me.

156
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:52,870
We can now visit this by opening up the browser and navigating to localhost, argued Amy.

157
00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:59,440
Upon arriving on the page, you'll be asked to begin installing WordPress.

158
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:00,940
Let's do this together.

159
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,430
You'll be asked to select your language.

160
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:05,020
Are we using English?

161
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:07,350
Select whatever language suits you best.

162
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:13,020
Afterwards, you'll be told that the WP config file isn't available.

163
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:16,950
WordPress will then ask you if you'd like to create this file now.

164
00:11:17,770 --> 00:11:24,070
I'm going to let WordPress generate this file before it can do so, it's going to ask us for the database

165
00:11:24,070 --> 00:11:24,730
details.

166
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:26,740
Let's go through it one by one.

167
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:33,530
The database name is Udemy and their user name is Root, there is no password and will leave the rest

168
00:11:33,530 --> 00:11:37,190
as is the last field is table prefix.

169
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:41,630
The table prefix allows you to give your database tables a unique name.

170
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:46,640
Whatever you input here will be prefixed to all the tables WordPress generates.

171
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:51,050
WordPress will generate a little over 10 different tables for your site.

172
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:55,000
The names it generates tend to be very simple and basic.

173
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:56,540
This can cause issues.

174
00:11:56,540 --> 00:12:02,660
If you already have tables inside your database to avoid naming conflicts, you can set a prefix to

175
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:04,390
give each table a unique name.

176
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:07,940
For example, there is a table named posts.

177
00:12:08,210 --> 00:12:14,360
If you set the prefix to WP underscore, then the new name will be WPE underscore posts.

178
00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:19,110
You should always be mindful of the setting as will be using in ourselves in the future.

179
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:21,650
For now, I'm going to leave this assets.

180
00:12:22,130 --> 00:12:24,200
If you don't understand, that's fine.

181
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:26,870
You'll understand what I mean in a future lecture.

182
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:28,370
Run the installation.

183
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:37,620
After some time, you should see a success message, you'll be then asked to input some basic details

184
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:42,240
about your site and set up a user account input, whatever details you want.

185
00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:44,580
You can just copy what I put, if you like.

186
00:12:46,810 --> 00:12:51,070
Once you're finished, you should see a success message and you can now log in.

187
00:12:55,700 --> 00:13:01,580
Congrats, we've successfully installed WordPress, we're pretty much done, there's one last thing

188
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:03,630
I want you to do before you finish things up here.

189
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:11,240
Go ahead and log into your WordPress site, then go to Settings Permalink, change the permalink settings

190
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,290
to Postnet.

191
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,250
This will make our new URLs easy to read.

192
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:18,350
It's not necessary, but it will make your life simpler.

193
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:19,910
We're now finished.

194
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:23,000
That was a lot to go through, but hopefully you got through it.

195
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,040
Oh.
