<p>Congratulations on making it this far! You can view all the lecture notes here just in case you need them. Please be sure to let me know if you have any questions. Thanks!</p><h4>LectureNotes</h4><p><strong>Gutenberg</strong></p><ul><li><p>Gutenberg is a modern editor for creating content. It not only changes the editing experience, but the developer experience as well.</p></li><li><p>You can create blocks using ES5/Plain JavaScript, but that makes it hard to manage and read your code.</p></li><li><p>Using webpack, react and other libraries will make working with Gutenberg easier. Knowledge of these would be beneficial.</p></li></ul><p><strong>The Command Line / Terminal</strong></p><ul><li><p>The command line / terminal is a text interface for your computer. You can input commands to execute certain tasks.</p></li><li><p>You dont need to be a pro at the command line to start single page app. You just need to know your way around.</p></li><li><p>Some examples show a <strong>$</strong> to indicate that text after this character is user input. You can safely ignore it.</p></li><li><p>If youre on a windows machine, then you should use the powershell rather than the command prompt. The powershell has more commands that function the same way as unix like machines.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Getting Started with NodeJS</strong></p><ul><li><p>Node.js is a program that allows you to run JavaScript code on your computer and/or server.</p></li><li><p>Node.js can do many things such as creating a web server, working with files, custom commands and so much more.</p></li><li><p>After installing node.js, youll have a new command called <strong>node</strong> which will run any JavaScript file inside the console.</p></li><li><p>Well be using Node.js to help with organizing, minifying and concatenating all the files well need for our single page app.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Modules and CommonJS</strong></p><ul><li><p>Every file is considered a module as far as Node.js is concerned. The main module that starts everything is called the entry point.</p></li><li><p>To load a module, you need to use the <strong>require() </strong>function and pass in the path to the module.</p></li><li><p>Only the data inside the <strong>module.exports</strong> property is provided to modules that load a module. Nothing else.</p></li><li><p>Children modules can also load in their own modules. There is no limit to how deep modules can be loaded. This creates a module tree structure.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Built-in and 3rd Party Modules</strong></p><ul><li><p>To create a <strong>package.json </strong>file you can run the <strong>npm init </strong>command or create the file manually.</p></li><li><p>The <strong>package.json</strong> file contains settings related to your project and the modules you use.</p></li><li><p>You can use flags to manipulate how commands work. The name and format of flags vary from developer to developer.</p></li><li><p>Youll usually save modules as production or development dependencies depending on the flag you use.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Introduction to Webpack and Dependencies</strong></p><ul><li><p>Webpack is a module bundler. It will process your HTML, CSS, JavaScript and other file types.</p></li><li><p>When you install webpack, youre provided a command called <strong>webpack</strong> which will bundle your modules together.</p></li><li><p>Dependencies are modules that are required to make your app work. They are meant for the production part of your site.</p></li><li><p>Developer dependencies are modules that are required for the development phase of your app.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Webpack Configuration</strong></p><ul><li><p>Webpack requires that you create a <strong>webpack.config.js</strong> file with all your settings. You define where the entry point and output files.</p></li><li><p>The <strong>__dirname</strong> constant will contain the path to the file its currently being used in.</p></li><li><p>The webpack CLI is a separate module that must be installed.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Webpack Loaders and Babel</strong></p><ul><li><p>Babel is a JavaScript compiler that converts your code into JavaScript that node and browsers can understand.</p></li><li><p>Webpack loaders are a way to load 3rd party modules that hook into the webpack process.</p></li><li><p>Webpack and babel are completely independent from each other so you can use either one without the other.</p></li><li><p>Babel is very modular. Its split into various modules. Youll usually find yourself installing a minimum of 3 modules when using Babel.</p></li></ul><p><strong>ES6 Constants and Let</strong></p><ul><li><p>ES6 comes with 2 new keywords for defining variables which are <strong>const</strong> and <strong>let</strong>.</p></li><li><p>Constants are variables that can never be changed once they are set. Attempting to change a constant will result in an error.</p></li><li><p><strong>Let</strong> variables are variables that can be manipulated in the scope theyre defined.</p></li><li><p>Babel and webpack will convert the <strong>const </strong>and <strong>let</strong> keywords to <strong>var </strong>so that your code is backwards compatible.</p></li></ul><p><strong>ES6 Arrow Functions</strong></p><ul><li><p>Arrow functions are similar to regular JavaScript functions except written differently.</p></li><li><p>Arrow functions can have no parenthesis wrapped around the parameters if there is only 1 parameter available.</p></li><li><p>Arrow functions are popular because they are shorter to write and easier to read.</p></li><li><p>Its important to note that arrow functions do not have a scope. It will instead use the scope of its parent.</p></li></ul><p><strong>ES6 Modules and Destructuring</strong></p><ul><li><p>ES6 modules is the official way of creating modules in JavaScript.</p></li><li><p>You can export multiple values and optionally export a default value. All exported values besides the default value require a name.</p></li><li><p>Destructuring allows you extract properties from objects. Not impressive by itself. Its used with other features of JavaScript.</p></li><li><p>ES6 modules and destructuring are used together a lot in examples and actual production applications.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Getting Started with React</strong></p><ul><li><p>React is a JavaScript library for creating complex User interfaces or single page applications. Can also be used for creating mobile &amp; desktop apps.</p></li><li><p>Components are reusable HTML elements. Theyre written like a function but are used like an HTML element.</p></li><li><p>JSX is a different form of JavaScript. It is NOT HTML. Babel will convert any JSX into JavaScript functions that will take create of creating elements.</p></li><li><p>Some attributes will not work such as the <strong>class</strong> attribute.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Reusing Components and Properties</strong></p><ul><li><p>You must have a root element for your JSX components. Otherwise youll be given an error.</p></li><li><p>Properties are the attributes and data passed down onto a component. Its how you create custom values.</p></li><li><p>To access the properties, you need to accept in the <strong>props</strong> object and then access the values by their attribute name.</p></li></ul>
