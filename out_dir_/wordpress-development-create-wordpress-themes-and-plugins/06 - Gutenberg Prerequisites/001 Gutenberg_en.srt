00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:14,180
Just recently, WordPress introduced a new editor called Gutenberg Gutenberg is a visual editor for

2
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:15,780
creating posts and content.

3
00:00:16,129 --> 00:00:20,750
If you were to go to the admin dashboard and create a new post, then you should see something like

4
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:21,170
this.

5
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:26,780
Gutenberg introduces a more modern and intuitive editing experience like never before.

6
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:31,750
For the past decade, WordPress use tiny MCE as the main editor.

7
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:34,800
It worked, but it was lacking in many areas.

8
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:39,320
If you've used WordPress before, then you are probably familiar with it.

9
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:42,690
If you don't know what it is, then that's perfectly fine.

10
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:48,740
It's currently being pushed out of WordPress, so it isn't required to know regardless if you're a fan

11
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:53,690
of Gutenberg or not, it's part of the KORNEL, so it would be beneficial to know how to extend it.

12
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:59,350
During the creation of this course, I struggled with how to approach grundberg development.

13
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:04,970
It's not just the editing experience that has changed, but the development experience has changed as

14
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:05,280
well.

15
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:08,620
Certain books aren't encouraged as much anymore.

16
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:13,760
The Shortcode API and metabolises are being replaced with something called Bloks.

17
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:18,380
If you take in my course before then, you may be familiar with these concepts.

18
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:20,720
If not, then that's perfectly fine.

19
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:23,780
I do go over some of this stuff later in this course.

20
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:30,440
The reason I'm mentioning it now is because you may look for more tutorials online and those tutorials

21
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:33,230
can be outdated because of the introduction of Gutenberg.

22
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:38,300
On top of some breaking changes, Gutenberg also has a higher learning curve.

23
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:43,540
Gutenberg is built with react and therefore you should be confident with your JavaScript skills.

24
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:50,470
From the beginning, I told you that you should have a solid understanding of HTML, S.O.S and JavaScript.

25
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:56,390
However, we're going to begin diving into more advanced topics, so I don't expect you to know these

26
00:01:56,390 --> 00:01:57,530
advanced concepts.

27
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:04,700
Before you can get into Gutenberg development, you need to know what erro functions, imports and structuring

28
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:04,910
are.

29
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,610
That's what I'll be teaching you in this section.

30
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:12,980
If you are already comfortable with these topics, then you can skip this section and move on to the

31
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:13,460
next one.

32
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:18,680
This section will completely step away from WordPress to discuss these important topics.

33
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:25,190
Before we get started, I do want to clarify that there are two ways to approach Gutenberg development.

34
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:29,330
The first approach is by using S5 or simple JavaScript.

35
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,730
This is the more simpler approach.

36
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:35,150
This is how we've been creating our plug ins and themes thus far.

37
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:37,670
No fancy tools or libraries.

38
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:40,870
You just write regular JavaScript and you're good to go.

39
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:45,440
The problem with this approach is that it makes your code harder to read and manage.

40
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:50,210
By now you should know that I'm all about organization and management.

41
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:57,200
While it does require a little more work, organizing your code allows for better scaling by using plain

42
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:01,880
JavaScript and P, you make Gutenberg development more difficult for yourself.

43
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:05,750
The second approach is by using React Web and Bable.

44
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:09,170
This approach has a higher learning curve, but it's well worth it.

45
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:12,580
You will find it easier to manage and organize your code.

46
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:16,100
This is the solution will be using for the rest of this course.

47
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:19,370
Once again, you're not required to know these things.

48
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:24,610
I will teach you how to use technologies and how they specifically tie to WordPress.

49
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,420
All right, let's get started.

50
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,250
I'll see you in the next lecture.
