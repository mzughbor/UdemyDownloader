1
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:12,960
The very first thing you'll need to know is the command line, the command line can be very intimidating,

2
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,130
especially if you're new to Web development.

3
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:19,820
However, you will need to know your way around if you plan on doing Leuchtenburg development.

4
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,620
So that's what you'll be learning in this lecture.

5
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:28,700
The command line is extremely powerful, but you actually don't need to know every feature there is.

6
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:32,580
There are dozens of commands, but will only be learning a handful.

7
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:37,150
The reason being is because we don't need to know the other commands or even use them.

8
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:42,900
You don't have to be a master at using the command line, especially when it comes to WordPress.

9
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:47,990
The commands I teach you here will be the only commands you'll need for the rest of this course.

10
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:49,530
So let's get started.

11
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:53,130
The very first thing you want to do is open up the command line.

12
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:57,180
The command line can be opened by searching for the phrase command prompt.

13
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:01,860
If you're on a Windows machine, if you're on a Linux or Mac, then this will be called terminal.

14
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:07,050
The command line is just this basic window with a black background and white text.

15
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,460
Before there were websites and user interfaces, we had the command prompt.

16
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:15,120
Everything you ever wanted to do would be through the command prompt.

17
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:21,180
The reason you would use a command prompt is because it's ten times faster than using an interface.

18
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:23,970
You don't really need an interface for everything.

19
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:27,720
And as web developers, we want to do everything as fast as we can.

20
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:34,920
Not only that, Web servers themselves generally don't have interfaces, so learning how to use the

21
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,330
command line is beneficial.

22
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:40,680
If you're on a Windows machine, then you're faced with a major disadvantage.

23
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,240
The command prompt doesn't use the exact same commands as Linux or Mac.

24
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:50,800
This is a problem as most tutorials and resources use Unix like commands.

25
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:53,400
This has been a problem for a very long time.

26
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:57,860
However, Microsoft developed another command line called the Power Shell.

27
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:00,390
I want you to search for that and open it up.

28
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:05,090
The power shell is a newer and faster command line than the command prompt.

29
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:12,240
Not only is it faster, but it has the same exact commands as Unix like systems will be using the power

30
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,850
shell for the rest of this lecture.

31
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:18,330
That way you don't have to memorize two different commands for the same thing.

32
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:22,110
When you first open the command line, you won't see much initially.

33
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,840
You'll just see where you are in your directory.

34
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:30,840
Some command lines will have a dollar sign to indicate that anything after that sign is user input,

35
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:33,060
a.k.a. your own commands or text.

36
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:36,420
Right now I'm able to see my full path.

37
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:41,760
I'm inside the C Colon Backslash Users Backslash Jack directory.

38
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:45,180
Some command lines will not even show you the full path.

39
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:47,820
The reason for this is to save some space.

40
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:53,220
You may be in a directory that has a long name and it would be kind of annoying to have to see it for

41
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:54,660
every line on the command line.

42
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:59,550
If you ever want to see the full path, then you simply type in P WD.

43
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:02,930
TWD is short for present working directory.

44
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:07,140
Upon entering this command, you'll see the full path you're currently in.

45
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:13,860
This is super useful, especially if you can't use something like the Explorer to tell you exactly where

46
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:14,310
you want.

47
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:20,940
Now that we have an idea of where we are, let's learn to navigate around before you can navigate around,

48
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:24,450
you have to know where you can navigate to the next command.

49
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:27,060
You need to know is the Elst command.

50
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,970
This command is sure for the word list.

51
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:31,320
Enter this commands.

52
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:35,520
This will output a list of files and folders currently in the directory.

53
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,180
You're working it.

54
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:42,300
As you can see here, I have all these files and folders along with information about when the last

55
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:44,880
time each file was modified and their permissions.

56
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,930
Now that I have an idea of where I am, let's move into a folder.

57
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:55,620
To move into a folder, you need to use the C D command, which is short for change directory.

58
00:03:56,010 --> 00:04:00,120
After this command, you have to input the name of the directory you'd like to move into.

59
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:06,360
I want to move into the music directory, so I'll input that and press enter just like that.

60
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,310
I'm inside the music directory.

61
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:12,630
If I wanted to move back, I would have to use the CD command again.

62
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:18,810
But this time I would input two dots like so two dots represent up one directory.

63
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,810
This command will move up one directory.

64
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:23,730
We are back to where we started.

65
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:28,260
If I wanted to move up multiple directories, then I would just input dot.

66
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:33,510
Dot forgot this will take me all the way up to the root of my drive.

67
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:38,490
You can use forward slash is to indicate that you'd like to move through multiple directories.

68
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:42,150
This also applies to moving into directories.

69
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:46,590
I know for a fact that my Zamp installation is inside this directory.

70
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:54,060
I'm going to move into the T docs directory by inputting CD Zamp Slash HD docs.

71
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:58,180
Let's make this into an exercise.

72
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:03,320
I want you to move into your H.T. docs directly using the CD command.

73
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:06,720
If you're not completely sure where it is, then it's fine to cheat.

74
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:10,590
You can open the file explorer and check where the full path is.

75
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:17,460
Once you know where the path is, then you just use the LS and CD commands to help navigate your way

76
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:22,540
around the command line to verify that I'm inside the H.G. Docs folder.

77
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:25,710
I want to use the LS Command to view the folders.

78
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:29,200
I'll find my projects and the Udemy folder here as well.

79
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:34,280
There's one last command I want to use and that's the mkdir command.

80
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:37,050
This command is short for make directory.

81
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:39,630
This will create a new folder.

82
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:42,870
I want to create a folder called Lern Dash.

83
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:46,500
JS entered this commands and a new folder should be made.

84
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,170
Let's double check this.

85
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:52,950
I want you to open your editor and then open this directory inside your editor.

86
00:05:54,780 --> 00:06:00,330
That's basically it when it comes to commands, not much to it, honestly, these commands will just

87
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:02,080
help you navigate around the command line.

88
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:06,270
There's other commands that will help with modifying and deleting files.

89
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:10,590
But you don't need to know, though, since we'll be working in an editor most of the time.

90
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:17,010
If you have a visual studio code like me, then you'll be able to open the command line by going to

91
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:18,750
view integrated terminal.

92
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:23,870
One of the great things about this is that it automatically points to the current directory you're in.

93
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:25,980
This is a huge timesaver.

94
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:30,940
So you won't have to use this command every time you wanted to move into this directory.

95
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:34,560
I'll be using this terminal throughout the rest of this course.

96
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:36,780
If you don't have it, then that's fine.

97
00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:41,370
You can continue using the command line your operating system has provided you.
