1
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:12,880
In the previous lecture, we learned how to make a template for the single member page, it's incomplete,

2
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:14,710
but we'll get it fixed in this lecture.

3
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:16,450
Here comes the real challenge.

4
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:20,350
We will have to read the code to figure out where to apply these changes.

5
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,180
Let me show you what I mean.

6
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:28,300
In the resource section of this lecture, I provide a link to the theme compatibility and template files

7
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:28,780
page.

8
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:33,890
This page pretty much goes over what we learned in the last section, so we'll skip over some of it.

9
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:40,120
What I want you to focus on is this section called overloading template compatibility theme files.

10
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:46,120
If you take a look, buddy, press documents that there are files that load template parts in this directory,

11
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:50,890
BP dash templates, BP dash legacy slash buddy press.

12
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:53,780
However, we won't be using this template.

13
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,180
The reason being is that it's an old template.

14
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:57,670
Let me show you what I mean.

15
00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:04,090
Inside the plugins folder, open the buddy press plug and navigate to the BP templates directory.

16
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:13,860
Upon coming to this directory, you'll find two folders called BP Legacy and BP nouveaux the BP Nuvo

17
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:16,260
template is what Buddy Press will use by default.

18
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:20,580
It's a template that comes with the latest standards of HTML access.

19
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:26,280
The BP legacy template is for sites that are still using the old template, but would like to use the

20
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:29,160
latest features of Buddy Press, the HTML.

21
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:32,340
NCIS is not up to par with today's standards.

22
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:37,010
Unfortunately, the new template is not very well documented on the site.

23
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:39,900
A lot of the code still refers to the old template.

24
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:44,820
This means that you'll have to study the code yourself to figure out things yourself.

25
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:47,430
I'll try my best to guide you in this course.

26
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:52,560
For this course we'll be using Nuvo since it contains code for the latest standards.

27
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:58,590
This directory is where Buddy Press stores its own template and HTML files for loading certain sections

28
00:01:58,590 --> 00:01:59,430
of Buddy Press.

29
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:01,240
So what do I mean by that?

30
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,710
Well, let's explore how Buddy Press loads a page again.

31
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:10,740
When a user visits a page generated by Buddy Press, the first thing Buddy Press will do is search for

32
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:12,600
that page specific template file.

33
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:15,330
Let's say the page was this member page.

34
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:19,350
It will then use the template hierarchy system to search for that template.

35
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:25,470
If it doesn't exist, it'll just use the base template, which would be the buddy press file.

36
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:31,380
After it finds the main template, Buddy Press will then proceed to load the various sections and pieces

37
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:32,640
that make up that page.

38
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:38,790
If we take a look at the single member page, all this content is just various files loaded on to one

39
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:39,350
page.

40
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,940
This cover image is its own template.

41
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:45,990
The menu is its own template, and then this form is also its own template.

42
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:48,210
It's not all stuffed into one file.

43
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:53,940
Buddy Press will first search in the current activated theme for these files and parts.

44
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:59,600
For example, if it wanted to load the cover image, it'll search the theme folder for that part.

45
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:05,010
Currently, the only template we have is the index template for the single member page.

46
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:09,120
Therefore, Buddy Press will not find that template part in our theme.

47
00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:13,320
Next, Buddy Press will search for the template inside its own folder.

48
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:20,100
As you can already guess, Buddy Press will search for those files inside the beep templates slash BP

49
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:24,720
nouveau slash buddy press directory to make things simpler and faster.

50
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:29,550
We could copy the buddy press directory into the themes root directory like so.

51
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:39,530
However, you don't want to do this, a lot of developers fall into this trap of just grabbing each

52
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:44,540
template and putting it inside their theme, but that comes with the price of being too difficult to

53
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:45,530
debug and handle.

54
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:49,970
My suggestion is to only include the files you plan on overwriting.

55
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:55,720
Otherwise you're just overdoing it and making it harder on yourself to have to manage so many templates.

56
00:03:56,060 --> 00:04:01,310
So I'm going to undo this action which should be left with the original templates we use, which is

57
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:02,870
just the index template.

58
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:07,590
Now that you know how Buddy Press loads its template, we can begin customizing it.

59
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:09,770
Here's where the problem arises.

60
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:12,950
How do we know which file is loaded for which page?

61
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,830
Buddy Press doesn't give you much information on that.

62
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:21,230
Inside their documentation, they only tell you the bare minimum and then leave the rest to you to figure

63
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:21,510
out.

64
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:24,200
This is a criticism I have of buddy press.

65
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:27,200
WordPress is greatly documented and well written.

66
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:29,750
It even goes over some complex topics.

67
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:33,680
However, the Buddy Press plugin only covers the basics.

68
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:39,380
There aren't a lot of examples of usages that you can use, so you're left to figure it out on your

69
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:39,700
own.

70
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:44,160
You have to open up the files and read the code to figure out what goes where.

71
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:47,770
Luckily, not everything is as hard as it seems.

72
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:52,190
If you take a look, you'll notice that Buddy Press organizes everything pretty well.

73
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:57,830
For example, all files in the activity folder relates to the activity page.

74
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:03,500
With that logic in mind, we can assume that the template parts related to the single member page is

75
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:06,550
located inside the member's single directory.

76
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:08,680
That narrows it down quite a bit.

77
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:12,530
Let's study the HTML generated by WordPress.

78
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:18,170
I want you to inspect the element and try to find the div tag with the ID buddy press.

79
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:26,200
Every single bloody press page will generate this tag, you can always expect Buddy Press to insert

80
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,250
its content in between these tags.

81
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:32,950
It's also a great way to apply success stylings to buddy press content only.

82
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:36,250
All right, let's take a deeper look at this.

83
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:43,600
Page is made up of two main tags, which are the item header and BP wrap elements inside the item header

84
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,070
element.

85
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:47,940
You'll find a div tag with the idea of cover image container.

86
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:53,500
What I'm doing right now is studying the HTML so that I can have a better idea of what to look for when

87
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:54,940
I'm searching through the templates.

88
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:59,850
The BP wrap element contains the rest of the content which we want centered.

89
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:05,170
Therefore, it would make sense to apply our classes that can your content to this tag.

90
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:10,480
I've already studied a lot of this HTML, so I have a good idea of what to look for.

91
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:14,250
Feel free to pause the video and study the HTML some more.

92
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:20,530
After studying the HTML, I will then look through the template files until I find something that matches

93
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:22,870
the HTML outputted by Buddy Press.

94
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:25,090
I've already looked through these files.

95
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:32,820
I was able to find that the home file inside the member's single directory encompasses all this content.

96
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,540
Open this file now.

97
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:39,950
As you can see, this is the file we're looking for.

98
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:47,240
It has the div tags with the classes, item header and BP rep, the next step is to copy this file into

99
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,220
the respective directory in our theme.

100
00:06:57,010 --> 00:07:03,520
Inside are a copy of the file, I'm going to apply the class container to the div tag with the class

101
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,580
of BP wrap.

102
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:09,330
This is a bootstrap class that was part of my template already before I started this theme.

103
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:11,710
It'll take care of censoring the content.

104
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:18,790
Let's refresh the page and you should now see the navigation and body being centered.

105
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:22,930
The only thing we need to center is the avatar and the header information.

106
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,420
Here's the problem, though.

107
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:30,390
If you take a look at the item header tag, you'll find that this tag also has the cover image inside.

108
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:35,980
If we were to center, this tag will also be centering the cover image, which isn't what we want.

109
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:42,060
So the next thing to do is to look for the template that contains all this HTML and center.

110
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:48,180
What we want to center, unlike last time, we don't have to study the HTML and look through files to

111
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:50,850
find the file that contains the HTML for this.

112
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:58,400
Going back to the Buddy Press home file we copied over inside the div tag with the class of item header.

113
00:07:58,650 --> 00:08:00,270
There's this function being called.

114
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:03,750
It's called BP Nuvo member header template part.

115
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:10,290
I'm going to copy this function and then switch over to the search feature of Visual Studio Code.

116
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:14,710
I'm going to pace in the function along with the function keyword before it.

117
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:17,100
I'll leave the rest of the fields empty.

118
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:20,900
What we're going to do is search for where this function was defined.

119
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:25,910
In order for us to understand what a function does, we'll have to examine the code itself.

120
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:29,170
This may take a while for some of you, so just be patient.

121
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:32,000
We should receive one result here.

122
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,360
We have the function being defined by Buddy Press right above.

123
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,049
It is a comment telling us what this function does.

124
00:08:38,419 --> 00:08:43,760
It says the following use the appropriate member header and enjoy its template hierarchy.

125
00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:46,010
That doesn't tell us a whole lot.

126
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:50,930
Basically what it does is choose an appropriate header template and buddy press.

127
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:53,600
You have the option of disabling cover images.

128
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:56,330
You can find that option on the settings page.

129
00:08:56,630 --> 00:09:00,260
This function will check if that option is enabled or disabled.

130
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:04,730
By default, the template variable will be set to member header.

131
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:11,360
The value member header refers to the cover image feature being disabled right after this is a conditional

132
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:11,810
statement.

133
00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:17,120
The function BP displayed user use cover image header is being called.

134
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:21,950
This function will take care of querying the database to check for the cover image setting.

135
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:26,180
If this returns true, then the cover image feature is enabled.

136
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:31,370
As a result, the template variable will be changed to cover image header.

137
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:37,430
Once the variable is set, Buddy Press will begin loading the template after the conditional statement

138
00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:41,900
for things are happening to do action functions are being called.

139
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:46,280
This is for other developers to add in content before or after the header.

140
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:48,530
We won't be using either of these.

141
00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:50,150
We can safely ignore them.

142
00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:55,490
In between these two functions is the function BP nouveaux member get template part.

143
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:01,760
This function will grab a template part based on the value passed in you may be thinking doesn't work.

144
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:04,760
Press already have a get template part function.

145
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:06,200
Yes it does.

146
00:10:06,770 --> 00:10:11,570
This function is a buddy press function that wraps the word press function get template part.

147
00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:16,850
The difference between these two functions is that the buddy press function will only look for the template

148
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:18,800
inside the body press plugin folder.

149
00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:23,930
By looking at this code, we can determine that the files containing the header code can be found in

150
00:10:23,930 --> 00:10:24,740
two files.

151
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:28,760
Those are the cover image header and member header files.

152
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:34,760
If we were to look inside the BP nouveaux template, you'll eventually come across the two files that

153
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:37,250
could be loaded which match the variable values.

154
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:44,660
Now that we know the files, let's just copy and paste them into the respective directories from the

155
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:45,740
plug into our theme.

156
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:54,960
So why are you files, well, Buddy Press allows the admin to enable and disable the cover image feature

157
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:58,600
as a result, there are two templates for both scenarios.

158
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:00,020
We will account for both.

159
00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:03,200
Let's start with the cover image header file.

160
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:07,110
This is the template that's used when the cover image feature is enabled.

161
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:12,070
When I was studying this file, I was looking for the tag that contains the image itself.

162
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:19,140
I was able to find that this div tag with the idea of header cover image contains the cover image itself.

163
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:23,590
I want to apply Sintering to all the content except for this tag.

164
00:11:24,010 --> 00:11:30,540
The tag that contains the avatar and information is this div tag with the ID item header cover image.

165
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:34,540
I was able to come to this conclusion by studying the HTML.

166
00:11:34,930 --> 00:11:38,260
I'm going to apply the container class to this tag.

167
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:41,760
That should do it.

168
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:47,270
Let's refresh the page, you should now see the avatar being centered while the cover image is still

169
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:47,880
stretched.

170
00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:49,780
This is exactly what we wanted.

171
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:55,430
Of course, not everyone who installs our theme and Buddy Press will want this cover image feature.

172
00:11:55,560 --> 00:12:01,160
So we'll have to account for that to go to the admin dashboard and navigate to settings.

173
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,720
Buddy press options.

174
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:10,030
I want you to uncheck the cover image uploads feature and save the changes.

175
00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:14,410
Let's refresh the page once more.

176
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:18,290
You should see the content uncensored along with no cover image.

177
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:25,360
Let's fix this inside the member header template, I'm going to create a div tag with the class container.

178
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:37,870
Then I'm going to move the two tags with the IDs, item header avatar and item header content inside

179
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:39,100
of this container tag.

180
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:51,200
That should center our avatar and the content, refresh the page and you should now see it centered.

181
00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:57,530
I'm going to re-enable the cover image feature because I like how it looks.

182
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:59,400
That wraps it up for this lecture.

183
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:04,100
All we did was study the HTML and find the appropriate templates for each section.

184
00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:09,940
It's kind of a pain, but it's the only way to go about Buddy Press theme development in the next lecture.

185
00:13:09,950 --> 00:13:13,550
We're going to continue working on this page and optimize it a little.
