1
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:12,780
In the beginning, we talked about the options available for running WordPress, at this point, you

2
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:14,540
should feel confident with WordPress.

3
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:19,470
Now I want to talk about an alternative environment called local by Flywheel.

4
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:22,550
Local is a WordPress specific environment.

5
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:26,330
It provides a lot of tools specifically for WordPress development.

6
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:31,950
If you scroll down a bit, you'll see some of the few features it has to offer and want you to download

7
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:32,640
this program.

8
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,260
It's absolutely free.

9
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:39,090
There's also a premium version, but you most likely won't need that unless you're on a team.

10
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,580
The file size will be quite large.

11
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:43,770
So paused the video while it's downloading.

12
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:50,740
Let's go through the installation together, local will tell you that it needs to install and configure

13
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:52,460
a couple of things before you can run it.

14
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:56,140
What local does is create a virtual machine for you.

15
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:58,020
When creating environments.

16
00:00:58,030 --> 00:00:59,380
You have two solutions.

17
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:04,750
You can download a program bundler like Zamp to automate a lot of the process for you.

18
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:11,200
Alternatively, you can set up a virtual machine, a virtual machine as a way to create an environment

19
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:16,090
with its own filesystem operating system and settings independent from your current machine.

20
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:22,630
The problem with a program bundler is that they don't accurately represent a real live production server.

21
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:27,490
The problem with the virtual machine is that there's a bit of a learning curve to using them.

22
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:30,710
This is where locals solve these two problems.

23
00:01:30,910 --> 00:01:37,010
It combines the friendly user experience of using a program bundler and features of a virtual box.

24
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:39,550
So with that being said, let's get started.

25
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:45,640
During this process, you could ask to approve certain permissions, just allow local to do its thing.

26
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:53,800
Once installed, you should see something similar to what I see, nothing drastic changes, unlike last

27
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:58,880
time, you don't have to download and install WordPress local will take care of that for you.

28
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,990
Let's create a new site.

29
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:03,130
You'll be asked to input a name.

30
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:06,180
I'm going to keep it simple and name it up.

31
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:08,160
You can name it whatever you want.

32
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:11,009
You'll then be asked about your environment settings.

33
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:13,840
This right here is what I love about local.

34
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:18,310
You can create various sites and each site can have its own environment.

35
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:22,930
You can have one environment with five and another with page seven.

36
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:26,560
You can also choose to use SGI, Index X or Apache.

37
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:32,320
The combinations are endless and local always keeps up to date with the latest changes in software.

38
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:35,080
I'm just going to go with the default settings.

39
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:37,300
You'll be asked about a couple more things.

40
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:39,130
Just keep going with the default.

41
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:42,730
Once you go through the setup, local will begin installing everything.

42
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:45,130
This is something you should be aware of.

43
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:49,770
Local tends to take up a lot of space on your drive, so make sure you have enough room.

44
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:54,760
The reason for this is because it generates a unique environment for each site you create.

45
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:56,890
This may take a while for some of you.

46
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:04,770
All right, so the setup is finally finished and we can begin using our site from the beginning, local

47
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:06,170
will build up the server for you.

48
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:11,630
You'll see all the settings displayed here, and you even have the option of changing your server settings

49
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:15,730
just in case you aren't happy with what you have to view your site.

50
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:17,660
Simply click the view site button.

51
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:18,770
Just like that.

52
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,130
We now have a WordPress site.

53
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,550
One thing you'll notice is the Eurail.

54
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:26,220
Unlike last time, we now have a unique domain for our site.

55
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:31,550
This is great as we don't have to worry about accessing our site from a nested folder structure.

56
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:37,160
If I go back to my control panel, you'll see we have a tab for the database right below.

57
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:42,890
You'll see all the database connection details so you can input those into Heidi Will to manage your

58
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:43,500
database.

59
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:49,340
Alternatively, you can click the admin or button and that will open a database management script in

60
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:49,970
your browser.

61
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:52,500
I honestly think this looks bad.

62
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:55,190
I always prefer to use Heidi, as you will.

63
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:58,720
In the end, it's up to you back in the control panel.

64
00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:03,170
You can even enable SSL, which is very useful when working with sensitive data.

65
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:09,790
SSL is always required when working with payment processors such as PayPal or Stripe in the next tab

66
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:10,150
over.

67
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:12,200
You also have the option of using mail.

68
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,910
Hogge, let's put this up.

69
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:19,000
Mail Hoong is a program that allows you to send and receive emails on your local machine.

70
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:21,899
This is automatically set up for you by local.

71
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:26,210
The last feature we have is the ability to make our site go live.

72
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:31,250
When you're working on a project and want to show your client what you have so far, then you can just

73
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:33,470
go live after a while.

74
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:38,210
The you are illustrative here and you can provide this link to other users to check out your WordPress

75
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:38,510
site.

76
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:41,040
Already you can see the power of local.

77
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:46,550
I highly recommend you play around with it and use it as your development environment for future projects.

78
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:51,150
I didn't show you earlier in the course because I thought it would be too overwhelming.

79
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:57,050
However, at this point, you should be able to understand what's going on here to find where the files

80
00:04:57,050 --> 00:04:57,830
are located.

81
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:59,990
You can just click on this little icon here.

82
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:03,590
It's very subtle, but this should open the file explorer for you.

83
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:06,950
You will automatically be pointing to your WordPress server.

84
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:09,980
Notice how I say server and not site.

85
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:15,590
Not only will you have WordPress installed, but you will also find the configuration files for your

86
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:21,170
server here to find the WordPress installation, you just navigate into app public.

87
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:25,550
The other files are just as worth exploring, though, so let's check those out.

88
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:30,350
You'll find another directory called Logs in the logs folder.

89
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:33,650
You'll find all the information outputted from each program.

90
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:37,520
Usually these would be error logs that can help you debug your site.

91
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:40,400
So that's about it when it comes to local.

92
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,950
A lot of great features in a single program.

93
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:48,020
Once you're finished working on your site, you can just click on the stop site button and that will

94
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:49,040
turn off your server.

95
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:54,380
If you want to make sites, then you can just click this plus icon on the bottom left corner.

96
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:56,300
Anyway, that's it for now.

97
00:05:56,450 --> 00:05:58,190
I'll see you in the next lecture.
