00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:13,720
In the past few sections, we've been working on creating a single plug in and theme, we've covered

2
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:15,040
a variety of topics.

3
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:20,770
At this point, you're more than ready to start developing your own plug ins and themes in this bonus

4
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:24,190
section of the course, we're going to explore some advanced topics.

5
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,540
A lot of these topics are useful when you're developing a large plug in our theme.

6
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:33,070
What you'll learn here will help you manage large amounts of code and projects.

7
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:37,460
A lot of this is experimental, and so you should approach this section with care.

8
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:43,690
This section gives a brief overview of some tools and techniques you can use once you're ready.

9
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:45,460
I'll see you in the next lecture.
