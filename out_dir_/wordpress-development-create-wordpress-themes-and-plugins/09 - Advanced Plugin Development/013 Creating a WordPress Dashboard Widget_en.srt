1
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:12,880
Let's keep adding on to the recipe, plug in, the next thing we want to do is create one of these dashboard

2
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:14,970
widgets on the WordPress admin page.

3
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:20,590
A lot of plug ins add dashboard, which is to provide more info about the plug in itself or the data

4
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:21,450
it provides.

5
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,990
It's perfect for adding a little news which it feeds so users can be kept up to date.

6
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:29,050
With your plug in, let's create one ourselves.

7
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:35,260
The widget will create will provide the latest five readings inside the main plug and file out an action

8
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:37,870
hook called WP Dashboard Setup.

9
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:41,590
The function to call is our ad dashboard widgets.

10
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:54,340
Create a file in the admin folder named Dashboard Dash Widgets and define the function here, as always,

11
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:57,760
make sure to include this file from the main plug and file.

12
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:05,820
Creating a dashboard, which is really easy.

13
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:11,150
You only have to call one function, which is the WP add dashboard widget function.

14
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:15,670
There are three parameters we need to set.

15
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:22,260
First is the slug, which can be thought of as a unique ID, set this to our latest recipe rating,

16
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:22,620
which it.

17
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:30,180
The second parameter is the title of our widget, set this to latest recipe ratings.

18
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:37,940
The last parameter is the function to call, which will display the contents of the widget, set this

19
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:40,520
to our latest recipe rating display.

20
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:45,850
In the same file, let's define the display function.

21
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:54,800
We want the widget to display the five latest ratings to do this, we'll need the PDB Global Object

22
00:01:55,350 --> 00:02:01,470
create a variable called latest ratings that will be set to the value returned by the get results method

23
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:03,570
of the PDB object.

24
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:10,970
The query will be using will simply select all the data in the recipe ratings recipe.

25
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:23,330
To get the latest entries, we have to set the order by for the ID column in descending order.

26
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,440
Lastly, limit the amount of results returned by five.

27
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:36,210
Next, echo out some yellow tags, and in between these tags will run a foreach loop that will loop

28
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:37,980
through the latest ratings array.

29
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:48,800
The get results method will return an array of results, each item in the array will be an object.

30
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:53,750
Now I'm going to create two variables for the title and permalink.

31
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:59,630
To get these values, we can use the functions, get the title and get the permalink, which will return

32
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:02,270
the values we need about a particular post.

33
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:10,770
Notice that we're using these functions inside the plug in and outside of the loop to use these functions

34
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:11,400
properly.

35
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:13,650
We have to pass in the post ID.

36
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:19,170
We can get the ID by accessing the recipe ID property from the rating object.

37
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,480
This is where we stored the post ID.

38
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:27,380
Lastly, I'm just going to paste in some HTML.

39
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:34,800
Nothing special going on in here, I'm just echoing out the values and displaying a message that informs

40
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:38,550
the user about which recipe received a rating and the rating itself.

41
00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:42,640
Save your changes and let's view the admin dashboard again.

42
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:47,130
We will now see our latest recipe, which it along with the latest ratings.

43
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:52,170
If you don't see any ratings, then try reading a recipe and come back to this page.
