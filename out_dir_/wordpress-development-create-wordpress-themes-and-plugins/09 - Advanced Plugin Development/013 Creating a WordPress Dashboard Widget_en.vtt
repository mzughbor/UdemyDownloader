00:07.270 --> 00:12.880
Let's keep adding on to the recipe, plug in, the next thing we want to do is create one of these dashboard

00:12.880 --> 00:14.970
widgets on the WordPress admin page.

00:15.310 --> 00:20.590
A lot of plug ins add dashboard, which is to provide more info about the plug in itself or the data

00:20.590 --> 00:21.450
it provides.

00:21.760 --> 00:25.990
It's perfect for adding a little news which it feeds so users can be kept up to date.

00:25.990 --> 00:29.050
With your plug in, let's create one ourselves.

00:29.260 --> 00:35.260
The widget will create will provide the latest five readings inside the main plug and file out an action

00:35.260 --> 00:37.870
hook called WP Dashboard Setup.

00:38.230 --> 00:41.590
The function to call is our ad dashboard widgets.

00:46.930 --> 00:54.340
Create a file in the admin folder named Dashboard Dash Widgets and define the function here, as always,

00:54.430 --> 00:57.760
make sure to include this file from the main plug and file.

01:03.470 --> 01:05.820
Creating a dashboard, which is really easy.

01:06.080 --> 01:11.150
You only have to call one function, which is the WP add dashboard widget function.

01:13.530 --> 01:15.670
There are three parameters we need to set.

01:16.020 --> 01:22.260
First is the slug, which can be thought of as a unique ID, set this to our latest recipe rating,

01:22.260 --> 01:22.620
which it.

01:25.020 --> 01:30.180
The second parameter is the title of our widget, set this to latest recipe ratings.

01:32.510 --> 01:37.940
The last parameter is the function to call, which will display the contents of the widget, set this

01:37.940 --> 01:40.520
to our latest recipe rating display.

01:43.030 --> 01:45.850
In the same file, let's define the display function.

01:48.060 --> 01:54.800
We want the widget to display the five latest ratings to do this, we'll need the PDB Global Object

01:55.350 --> 02:01.470
create a variable called latest ratings that will be set to the value returned by the get results method

02:01.470 --> 02:03.570
of the PDB object.

02:06.230 --> 02:10.970
The query will be using will simply select all the data in the recipe ratings recipe.

02:17.540 --> 02:23.330
To get the latest entries, we have to set the order by for the ID column in descending order.

02:23.840 --> 02:27.440
Lastly, limit the amount of results returned by five.

02:30.150 --> 02:36.210
Next, echo out some yellow tags, and in between these tags will run a foreach loop that will loop

02:36.210 --> 02:37.980
through the latest ratings array.

02:43.010 --> 02:48.800
The get results method will return an array of results, each item in the array will be an object.

02:49.370 --> 02:53.750
Now I'm going to create two variables for the title and permalink.

02:54.080 --> 02:59.630
To get these values, we can use the functions, get the title and get the permalink, which will return

02:59.630 --> 03:02.270
the values we need about a particular post.

03:04.680 --> 03:10.770
Notice that we're using these functions inside the plug in and outside of the loop to use these functions

03:10.770 --> 03:11.400
properly.

03:11.490 --> 03:13.650
We have to pass in the post ID.

03:14.430 --> 03:19.170
We can get the ID by accessing the recipe ID property from the rating object.

03:19.560 --> 03:21.480
This is where we stored the post ID.

03:24.170 --> 03:27.380
Lastly, I'm just going to paste in some HTML.

03:28.860 --> 03:34.800
Nothing special going on in here, I'm just echoing out the values and displaying a message that informs

03:34.800 --> 03:38.550
the user about which recipe received a rating and the rating itself.

03:39.210 --> 03:42.640
Save your changes and let's view the admin dashboard again.

03:42.990 --> 03:47.130
We will now see our latest recipe, which it along with the latest ratings.

03:47.430 --> 03:52.170
If you don't see any ratings, then try reading a recipe and come back to this page.
