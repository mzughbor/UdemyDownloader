Thanks!</p><h4>LectureNotes</h4><p><strong>Creating aWidget</strong></p><ul><li><p>Widgets are called at a weird time so make sure you include your widgets and functions using the full system path.</p></li><li><p>You must extend the <strong>WP_Widget </strong>class so WordPress can assist you with setting up the widget.</p></li><li><p>WordPress will take care of submitting, processing and display the values/fields. Use the <strong>get_field_name() </strong>and <strong>get_field_id()</strong> methods to help you generate the attributes.</p></li><li><p>The <strong>update() </strong>method allows you to filter the data your own way. Its important that you return the array so WordPress can update everything properly.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Cron Jobs and Transients API</strong></p><ul><li><p>Cron jobs are automated tasks that can perform daily, monthly, etc. WordPress comes with its own built-in task manager.</p></li><li><p>Its important that you unscheduled your cron jobs after your plugin is deactivated or else a users site might become bloated with unused code.</p></li><li><p>The transients API allows you to store cached data in the database. It allows you to set up an expiration time.</p></li><li><p>The <strong>widget() </strong>method is passed in an <strong>args </strong>array that contains values related to the themes sidebar HTML. You can use this HTML to format your widget.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Creating a Shortcode for Frontend Publishing</strong></p><ul><li><p>Shortcodes allow you to add dynamic code into the editor that can be replaced with more code.</p></li><li><p>The<strong> wp_editor() f</strong>unction will output the <strong>tinymce </strong>editor so you can use it in your plugins.</p></li><li><p>Its important that you use an ID that only contain lowercase letters and no spaces/underscores.</p></li><li><p>PHP output buffers help us grab content that would be otherwise outputted. You can grab the content and store it in a variable for later use.</p></li></ul><p><strong>SanitizingHTMLand Inserting a Post</strong></p><ul><li><p>WordPress will load a javascript called <strong>tinymce </strong>which use can use to interact with its advanced editor.</p></li><li><p>You can filter HTML using the<strong> wp_kses()</strong> function. This function allows you set what tags, attributes and protocol are allowed.</p></li><li><p>Alternatively, you can use the <strong>wp_kses_post() </strong>function to use the same settings WordPress uses for filtering its posts.</p></li><li><p>To insert a post you need to call the <strong>wp_insert_post()</strong> function. Only the title and content are required, but you can set a plethora of options to customize it.</p></li></ul><p><strong>CustomHooks with the Plugin APIand Sending E-mails</strong></p><ul><li><p>BBPress is a popular plugin that is extendable with even more plugins. It uses the WordPress plugin API to do this.</p></li><li><p>Call the<strong> do_action()</strong> function and pass it in a custom name to trigger a custom hook. WordPress will not throw any errors if the hook does not have any functions using it.</p></li><li><p>Anonymous functions are special functions with no names. You can pass in anonymous functions to your hooks rather than passing in a string.</p></li><li><p>The <strong>wp_mail()</strong> function will run the mail() function except itll call hooks to filter the data before sending out an email.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Creating the Login and Registration Forms</strong></p><ul><li><p>Membership plugins can increase the value of your theme by including them. Consider integrating one into your theme.</p></li><li><p>Nonces (Numbers only once) are a way to create tokens that you can use to verify the credibility of a request.</p></li><li><p>Its important that you manually authenticate the user if theyre logging in for the first time. Using a the <strong>wp_signon()</strong> function brings back mixed results.</p></li><li><p>Use the <strong>is_wp_error()</strong> function to verify if an object is a WordPress error object.</p></li></ul><p><strong>User Registration</strong></p><ul><li><p>Be sure to check if the user has registration turned on. This setting only applies to WordPress own registration form, but you should take advantage of it anyway.</p></li><li><p>All options are stored inside the <strong>options</strong> table. Plugins and transients are also stored inside this table.</p></li><li><p>Its always good practice to hide and display content depending if the user is logged in or not.</p></li></ul><p><strong>User Authentication</strong></p><ul><li><p>Use the <strong>wp_signon() </strong>function to authenticate a user with WordPress.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Alternative User Authentication</strong></p><ul><li><p>WordPress provides a way to log users in that youre allowed to extend or override.</p></li><li><p>Its good practice to find the hooks that WordPress uses and understand how WordPress functions. This gives you the opportunity to hook perfectly into the system to do what you desire.</p></li><li><p>The <strong>wp_loginform()</strong> function will generate the form for logging a user in for you. Itll also set up any additional fields WordPress will need to properly authenticate a user.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Adding a Logout Link</strong></p><ul><li><p>All menus can have dynamic menu items created using hooks. Use the <strong>wp_nav_menu_items</strong> hook to do just that.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Prepared Database Queries</strong></p><ul><li><p>The <strong>wpdb </strong>object has a <strong>prepare </strong>method that will sanitize queries. This is a great way to prevent SQL injections.</p></li><li><p>The <strong>prepare </strong>method has a similar functionality to PHPs PDO prepare method or MySQLIs prepare method.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Uninstalling a Plugin</strong></p><ul><li><p>WordPress provides 2 ways to hook into when a plugin is uninstalled from your site. The recommended way is to create a <strong>uninstall.php</strong> file that will handle the uninstallation.</p></li><li><p>Its good practice to check if WordPress is the one calling the<strong> uninstall.php</strong> file and not some outside user.</p></li><li><p>Its good practice to clean up after yourself so a user doesnt have a bloated site which can potentially lead to performance and security issues.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Creating a WordPress Dashboard Widget</strong></p><ul><li><p>WordPress admin dashboard widgets allow you to give web owners a glance at whats going on with your plugin. You can also use a dashboard widget to display news related to your plugin or software.</p></li><li><p>Call the<strong> wp_add_dashboard_widget()</strong> function to create a dashboard widget.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Using the HTTPAPI to Retrieve External Content</strong></p><ul><li><p>There are various methods and functions for retrieving content outside of your site. Some hosts will disable/enable these methods.</p></li><li><p>Rather than checking which method is available, you can use the HTTP API to let WordPress decide which method is best and available.</p></li><li><p>WordPress will return the results of most requests as an array with various pieces of information about the response.</p></li><li><p>A lot of this information can be parsed for you using a set of utility functions provided by WordPress.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Flushing the Rewrite Rules with the Rewrite API</strong></p><ul><li><p>The rewrite API is can potentially break your site if you are not careful.</p></li><li><p>WordPress uses the <strong>htaccess </strong>file to help generate SEO friendly URLs.</p></li><li><p>You need to flush the rules every time you plan on creating new rewrite rules. You can do this manually by updating the permalink settings or call the function <strong>flush_rewrite_rules()</strong>.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Shortcodes Explained In-Depth</strong></p><ul><li><p>Shortcodes can have attributes just like HTML elements. You can use these attributes to generate a more dynamic shortcode.</p></li><li><p>Attributes are optional so be sure to have some default values. You can use the <strong>shortcode_atts()</strong> function to filter the values.</p></li><li><p>Shortcodes can also be enclosed. Users can pass content inbetween and you can accept that as the second parameter to your shortcode function.</p></li></ul>
