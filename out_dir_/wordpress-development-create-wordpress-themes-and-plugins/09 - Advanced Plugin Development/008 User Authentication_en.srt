00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:13,000
In this lecture, we're going to finish up our shortcode by making the law informed work inside the

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,480
main JS file.

3
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:19,110
I'm going to copy and paste the previous JavaScript code we use for the register form.

4
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:24,400
I'm going to change a lot of this code from the field to the status messages so that they reflect the

5
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:25,090
log in the form.

6
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:28,910
Instead, the action will be recipe user login.

7
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:32,350
Make sure to update the status messages and selections.

8
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:33,730
Nothing crazy here.

9
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:39,430
It's what we did previously create a new Ajax Action hook with no privileges.

10
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:44,050
I'm going to copy and paste the action I used in the form object like so.

11
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:57,610
Create a file inside the process folder called login and define the function inside here, make sure

12
00:00:57,610 --> 00:00:59,590
to include it from the main plug and file.

13
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:10,720
Inside this function, I'm going to ground the first two lines from the create account file and paste

14
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:11,260
it in here.

15
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:19,950
I'm creating an output variable, grabbing and verifying the nonce and then checking to see if the username

16
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:21,370
and password was submitted.

17
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:25,920
I'm going to remove the e-mail and password confirmation from this check.

18
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:30,060
Really nothing new so far.

19
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:36,740
I'm going to create a new variable named user that will contain the value returned by the function WP

20
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:37,310
Sinon.

21
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:45,370
This function will authenticate users for you, this is the function I recommend you use when you're

22
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:50,740
authenticating users who have already logged in before this function has two parameters.

23
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:56,540
The first is an array of the login credentials it will use to verify and authenticate the current user.

24
00:01:56,980 --> 00:02:01,690
There are three fields we can set the user login except the username.

25
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:04,150
I'm going to sanitize this while I'm at it.

26
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:12,380
The next key is user password, which accepts the password.

27
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:18,560
Lastly, the remember key allows you to specify whether the user should be remembered on this device.

28
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:20,780
I'm going to set this to true.

29
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:30,080
This will suddenly user in just to make sure we're going to create another conditional statement checking

30
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:34,430
if this function returns, an error object using the IS error function.

31
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:37,970
If it is an error object, then we'll just kill the script.

32
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:43,070
Otherwise we'll update the status to two and kill the script once more.

33
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:54,450
That will take care of everything if you haven't already, log out and then try logging in.

34
00:02:57,050 --> 00:03:00,840
After confirming that everything works, there's one last thing we want to do.

35
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:02,200
We're almost finished.

36
00:03:02,210 --> 00:03:02,980
I promise.

37
00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:08,510
If you were to go to the admin dashboard and navigate to settings general, you'll find a setting called

38
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:09,770
anyone can register.

39
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:13,250
This setting controls word registration form.

40
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:17,450
Even if this is ticked off, plugins can still create accounts with code.

41
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:20,150
We're going to use this setting to our advantage.

42
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:21,830
I want to hide the form.

43
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:26,900
If registration is disabled, we'll start by creating a placeholder inside the template.

44
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:32,420
Find the div tag that contains the whole registration form and add show regg form.

45
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:41,120
Will replace this placeholder with a style attribute inside the shortcode function, add another string

46
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,170
replacement function.

47
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:52,180
For the replace function we're going to use, a ternary operator will be performing a check using a

48
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:58,000
function called get option, we haven't discussed the options API, but this function will grab the

49
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,620
options from the options table.

50
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:07,300
Using Heidi skill, you can open the WP options table, WordPress stores, all of its settings here.

51
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:10,390
It also stores transients and plug in options.

52
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:13,380
One of the options is users can register.

53
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:15,500
This is the option that is updated.

54
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:21,680
When you took the checkbox on the admin settings page, if the value is zero, then that means the registration

55
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,410
is closed.

56
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:25,610
If it's one, then that means registration is open.

57
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:31,720
We can pass this into the get option function and it'll tell us whether or not registration is open.

58
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:38,510
If this check returns false, we'll hide the registration form with a simple display success style.

59
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:47,160
Otherwise, it'll be empty and display, as is save your work, update the settings to disable registration

60
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,480
and try viewing the form.

61
00:04:55,580 --> 00:05:01,350
It should not display the very last thing I want to do is hide these forms if the user is logged in.

62
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,980
Right now I'm logged in and it should not be displaying inside the shortcode function.

63
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:10,220
Create a conditional statement at the very top call.

64
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:12,140
The function is user logged in.

65
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:15,710
If this returns true, we'll just return an empty string.

66
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:25,560
Refresh the page and you should see nothing up here, that's it, we're finally finished.

67
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:28,100
It was a lot to go through, but well worth it.
