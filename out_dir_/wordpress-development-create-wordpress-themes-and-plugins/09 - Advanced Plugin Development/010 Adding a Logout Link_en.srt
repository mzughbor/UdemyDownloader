1
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:10,400
The last thing I want to do is create a logout link.

2
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:16,390
There was already a logout link inside the admin WordPress bar, but I prefer to create one inside the

3
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:16,790
theme.

4
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:19,140
There are two ways we can go about this.

5
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:22,750
We could edit the theme and add the link, or we can use hooks.

6
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:27,430
In our case, either solution is valid since we're the creator of the theme.

7
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:30,430
But Hooke's work universally and we'll scale better.

8
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:34,410
We'll go with the hooks root inside the main plug and file.

9
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:38,740
I'm going to add a new filter hook called WP NAV Menu Items.

10
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:47,790
This hook is triggered when WordPress begins to load in the menu items for a theme navigation menu,

11
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:55,270
it'll be passed in the raw HTML menu items for us to manipulate the name of the function I want to call

12
00:00:55,270 --> 00:01:00,670
will be called Jiyu new NAV menu items with a priority of nine nine nine.

13
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:08,800
I set the priority to a high number, as I want the logout link to be placed at the end of the menu,

14
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:11,270
I'm going to create a new file.

15
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:17,670
Inside the includes a front folder called Logout Dash linked up and define the function here.

16
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:20,000
Lastly, make sure to include it.

17
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:31,180
Since this is a filter, function will be passed in a value and be expected to return it, the value

18
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:35,310
that's passed in is items, which is the raw HTML menu items.

19
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:38,920
The first thing I'm going to do is create a conditional statement.

20
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,590
I'm going to check if the user is logged in.

21
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:46,180
I'll be using the IS user logged in function to accomplish this.

22
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:54,390
I want to check if they're not logged in, if they aren't, then I'm just going to return the items

23
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:55,110
as it is.

24
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:57,690
There's no point in displaying the logout link.

25
00:01:57,690 --> 00:01:59,730
If they're not logged in in the first place.

26
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:06,180
If they are logged in, then I'm going to generate the link to the log out page, create a variable

27
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:07,250
named New Link.

28
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:11,820
I'm going to set its value to a pair of opening and closing line tags.

29
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:20,990
In between these tags, I'm going to call the function WP log in out this function will generate a link

30
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:23,720
to the login and log out pages of WordPress.

31
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:29,210
However, since we're only displaying this link, if the user is logged in, it will always show the

32
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:29,810
log out.

33
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:31,820
This is fine by us.

34
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:35,600
This function has two parameters which will want to take advantage of.

35
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:39,470
The first parameter is the URL to redirect the user to.

36
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:44,180
If they successfully log out, I'm going to set this to the home URL function.

37
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:50,510
I'll pass in a forward slash to indicate I want the Eurail to be the root URL and that should set up

38
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:51,340
the redirection.

39
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:55,640
The second parameter is whether this link should be echoed out or not.

40
00:02:56,030 --> 00:03:02,170
Since this is a filter function and I'm returning data, then I want this link to be returned by default.

41
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:05,570
This will be set to true, which will echo out the link.

42
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:12,170
I'm going to change this to false to return the link now that the link is generated properly.

43
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:18,470
All we have to do is return the items and append the new link variable along with these links.

44
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:26,890
After doing so, let's refresh the page and see what we get, the logout link should appear if you're

45
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:27,470
logged in.

46
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:29,860
There is one noticeable problem, though.

47
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:34,780
The logout link appears in both the primary and secondary navigation menus.

48
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,390
This is a bit redundant.

49
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:42,070
The filter hook we're using will apply our changes to all menu items, regardless of their status or

50
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:42,660
location.

51
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:48,970
Something I do want to know is that this filter hook will only apply to user generated menu items.

52
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:55,220
As you may know, WordPress will automatically generate a menu item if a user doesn't have one set up.

53
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:59,290
This is usually the case on Fresh Insulation's of WordPress.

54
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:05,740
Anyway, let's assume the user created a menu and we want the logout link to appear on the secondary

55
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:10,980
menu item only to force the link to appear in only the secondary menu.

56
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:15,530
We only have to make one small change back inside the main plugin file.

57
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:17,560
We'll have to update the filter hook.

58
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:19,630
This filter hook is dynamic.

59
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:22,870
This is optional though, to use the dynamic version.

60
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:28,060
All you have to do is add the menu log right after the WP nav menu phrase.

61
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:30,460
In this case it would be secondary.

62
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:38,900
Just like that, the links should appear only on the secondary menu, refresh the page to see the final

63
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:40,600
results that should do it.

64
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:46,310
If you want to learn more about the log in our function, then check out the resource section of this

65
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:46,820
lecture.

66
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:48,660
Oh.
